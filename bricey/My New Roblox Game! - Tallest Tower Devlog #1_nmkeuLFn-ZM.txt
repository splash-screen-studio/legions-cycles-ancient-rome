each player will have their own little

let's draw a few around in a

from every position will have to

gather resources and build

the tallest tower and at face value that

sounds pretty linear

what's gonna happen is each player will
what's gonna happen is each player will
what's gonna happen is each player will
be able to
be able to
be able to
knock down other people's towers and
knock down other people's towers and
knock down other people's towers and
their towers have to be structurally
their towers have to be structurally
their towers have to be structurally
secure or else they'll just fall over
secure or else they'll just fall over
secure or else they'll just fall over
so it's all physics based it might be a
so it's all physics based it might be a
so it's all physics based it might be a
little hard
little hard
little hard
to make the ownership changes work
to make the ownership changes work

but we should be fine
but we should be fine
but we should be fine
and yeah so it should work pretty well
and so here you can see i'm getting
and so here you can see i'm getting

i'm actually programming in visual

if i click on this part you can see it

flings around

and i can just drop it like on top of

you can see how it connects to my mouse

so wherever i put it it

so wherever i put it it
attaches to it but
attaches to it but
attaches to it but
i don't really know how i can make it
i don't really know how i can make it
i don't really know how i can make it
better for third person but
better for third person but
better for third person but
it allows me to stack parts which
it allows me to stack parts which
it allows me to stack parts which
will be a main focus of this game pretty
will be a main focus of this game pretty
will be a main focus of this game pretty
happy with this
happy with this
happy with this
and i'll probably take a break and get
and i'll probably take a break and get
and i'll probably take a break and get
back deving a little bit later
so now i started working on the throwing
so now i started working on the throwing
so now i started working on the throwing
and rotating of the part
and rotating of the part
and rotating of the part
and i tried to make the system as robust
and i tried to make the system as robust
and i tried to make the system as robust
as possible but you'll see later
as possible but you'll see later
as possible but you'll see later
i kind of had to change it a little bit
i kind of had to change it a little bit
i kind of had to change it a little bit
but basically the gist of it is i have
but basically the gist of it is i have
but basically the gist of it is i have
this class
this class
this class
or this modulus script that controls
or this modulus script that controls
or this modulus script that controls
when the player
when the player
when the player
or if the player can pick up a part and
or if the player can pick up a part and
or if the player can pick up a part and
how to pick it up and like
how to pick it up and like
how to pick it up and like
when it drops and when it throws so
when it drops and when it throws so
when it drops and when it throws so
basically when we throw the part we
basically when we throw the part we
basically when we throw the part we
basically drop it
basically drop it
basically drop it
and then add some velocity to it and
and then add some velocity to it and
and then add some velocity to it and
since this part is owned by the client
since this part is owned by the client
since this part is owned by the client
i can do this all client side and i
i can do this all client side and i
i can do this all client side and i
really don't have to use any remote
really don't have to use any remote
really don't have to use any remote
events for the server
so i've implemented the rotating and
so i've implemented the rotating and
so i've implemented the rotating and
throwing fee

feature and i have this little stack to
feature and i have this little stack to
feature and i have this little stack to
demonstrate so i can pick up a part
demonstrate so i can pick up a part
demonstrate so i can pick up a part
with my mouse and you can see no
with my mouse and you can see no
with my mouse and you can see no
depending on the
depending on the
depending on the
orientation of the part when i pick it
orientation of the part when i pick it
orientation of the part when i pick it
up it stays like that like relative to
up it stays like that like relative to
up it stays like that like relative to
me
me
me
so when i turn around like this it's
so when i turn around like this it's
so when i turn around like this it's
facing me but then when i pick it up
facing me but then when i pick it up
facing me but then when i pick it up
from the side
from the side
from the side
it'll keep on facing me from that side
it'll keep on facing me from that side
it'll keep on facing me from that side
and also when i press r i can rotate
and also when i press r i can rotate
and also when i press r i can rotate
right now if i hold it it doesn't do
right now if i hold it it doesn't do
right now if i hold it it doesn't do
anything so i really need to add a hold
anything so i really need to add a hold
anything so i really need to add a hold
feature

but for right now this works fine and
but for right now this works fine and
but for right now this works fine and
also when i press f
also when i press f
also when i press f
i can throw it you can see i can knock
i can throw it you can see i can knock
i can throw it you can see i can knock
down the tower
down the tower
down the tower
and that's kind of what i want this game
and that's kind of what i want this game
and that's kind of what i want this game
to be about you know building and
to be about you know building and
to be about you know building and
knocking down towers so i can
knocking down towers so i can
knocking down towers so i can
quickly demo one real quick
oh look at my tower it just fell over
oh look at my tower it just fell over
oh look at my tower it just fell over
don't mind that but
don't mind that but
don't mind that but
if we were to build a actual like secure
if we were to build a actual like secure
if we were to build a actual like secure
tower

we could take our part and just throw it
we could take our part and just throw it
we could take our part and just throw it
at someone else's
at someone else's
at someone else's
and just knock it down like that
so yeah
so i did a little progress off camera
so i did a little progress off camera
so i did a little progress off camera
and now basically what happens is
and now basically what happens is
and now basically what happens is
i can grab the part and wherever i grab
i can grab the part and wherever i grab
i can grab the part and wherever i grab
it
it
it
it'll make an align position at that
it'll make an align position at that
it'll make an align position at that
position with an attachment and you can
position with an attachment and you can
position with an attachment and you can
see this represented by this
see this represented by this
see this represented by this
like white line with this white sphere
like white line with this white sphere

so this actually works very nicely so i
so this actually works very nicely so i
so this actually works very nicely so i
can like
can like
can like
apply certain physics and just makes it

apply certain physics and just makes it
a little more robust the only problem
a little more robust the only problem
a little more robust the only problem
is right now the max distance in which
is right now the max distance in which
is right now the max distance in which
you can grab the part is like
you can grab the part is like
you can grab the part is like
20 studs and it automatically puts the
20 studs and it automatically puts the
20 studs and it automatically puts the
part to that distance no matter
