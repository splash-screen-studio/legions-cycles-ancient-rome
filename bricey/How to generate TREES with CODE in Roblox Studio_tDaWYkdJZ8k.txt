I'm here in a blank base plate going to
I'm here in a blank base plate going to
I'm here in a blank base plate going to
create my new base part. And I want this
create my new base part. And I want this
create my new base part. And I want this
to be wood colored and shaped. So, we're
to be wood colored and shaped. So, we're
to be wood colored and shaped. So, we're
going to make it look like wood. And the
going to make it look like wood. And the
going to make it look like wood. And the
first thing we want to note, this is a
first thing we want to note, this is a

very like pedantic thing, but I think
very like pedantic thing, but I think
very like pedantic thing, but I think
it's pretty important is um notice how
it's pretty important is um notice how
it's pretty important is um notice how
that the wood grain, so like the lines
that the wood grain, so like the lines
that the wood grain, so like the lines
of the wood are going, you know, left to

right here, like left to right here. Um
right here, like left to right here. Um
right here, like left to right here. Um
also here, and then these are like going

X-axis is going to be to the right of
X-axis is going to be to the right of
X-axis is going to be to the right of
the forward and up. So, forward is this

So now I'm going to create a function
So now I'm going to create a function
So now I'm going to create a function
local function generate tree and then
local function generate tree and then
local function generate tree and then
this function is going to take in two
this function is going to take in two

generate tree recursive function. Now
generate tree recursive function. Now
you could do this using a for loop. It's
you could do this using a for loop. It's
you could do this using a for loop. It's
just in this case a lot easier to use
just in this case a lot easier to use

to put the leaf in the base case. So,
we're going to need this pivot
we're going to need this pivot
we're going to need this pivot

pivot is just getting the pivot C frame.
So it's going to be like this thing at
So it's going to be like this thing at
So it's going to be like this thing at
the bottom. And then we need to get the
the bottom. And then we need to get the
the bottom. And then we need to get the
origin of the next block. So this is the
origin of the next block. So this is the
origin of the next block. So this is the
current pivot of the parent and this is
current pivot of the parent and this is
current pivot of the parent and this is
the origin of the like new branch. So
the origin of the like new branch. So
the origin of the like new branch. So
this origin needs to be transformed. So
this origin needs to be transformed. So
this origin needs to be transformed. So
we're here and we need to get all the

you know the size. So let's just see.
It's going to be the X size. So the X

where where is the here? Go down here.
where where is the here? Go down here.
So the X size is where is the size?
So the X size is where is the size?
So the X size is where is the size?
Okay, here's size. X size is like four.
Okay, here's size. X size is like four.
Okay, here's size. X size is like four.
So this is like how tall it is. So you
So this is like how tall it is. So you
So this is like how tall it is. So you
take the pivot and you just add four.

take the pivot and you just add four.
Oh, I just realized I made the pivot of

Oh, I just realized I made the pivot of
the model. We don't really care about

the pivot of the model. You need to go
the pivot of the model. You need to go
the pivot of the model. You need to go
to the root block and then set the pivot
to the root block and then set the pivot
to the root block and then set the pivot
down here. That's my bad. So uh recap
down here. That's my bad. So uh recap
down here. That's my bad. So uh recap
root part needs the pivot to be at the
root part needs the pivot to be at the

So basically we get the x-axis. So in
this case, it's going to be, you know,
this case, it's going to be, you know,
this case, it's going to be, you know,
up and down, like the long axis of our
up and down, like the long axis of our
up and down, like the long axis of our
wood grain. And then we're multiplying
wood grain. And then we're multiplying
wood grain. And then we're multiplying
it. So this x-axis is just a synonym for
it. So this x-axis is just a synonym for
it. So this x-axis is just a synonym for
um 1 0 0, like vector 3 new 1 0 0. Then
um 1 0 0, like vector 3 new 1 0 0. Then
um 1 0 0, like vector 3 new 1 0 0. Then
we're multiplying it by the size. So
we're multiplying it by the size. So
we're multiplying it by the size. So
we're basically creating a new vector
we're basically creating a new vector
we're basically creating a new vector
with everything zero except for the

then go all the way to the top, which

it's not really doing anything. So, we
it's not really doing anything. So, we
it's not really doing anything. So, we
need to
need to
need to
make our new branch and then move it to
make our new branch and then move it to

that new origin. And since the pivot is
that new origin. And since the pivot is
that new origin. And since the pivot is
at the base, we don't have to offset
at the base, we don't have to offset
at the base, we don't have to offset
where it moves. We just move it to this

So, in our case, the only property that

this takes in a C frame, our new C

we're going to pivot
we're going to pivot
we're going to pivot

a realistic like tree rotation algorithm
a realistic like tree rotation algorithm
a realistic like tree rotation algorithm
thing. But um what we're going to do is
thing. But um what we're going to do is
thing. But um what we're going to do is
we're going to take the input of the
we're going to take the input of the

over the max iteration. So basically how
over the max iteration. So basically how
over the max iteration. So basically how
far how far are we in the tree and then
far how far are we in the tree and then
far how far are we in the tree and then
what we're going to do is we need like
what we're going to do is we need like
what we're going to do is we need like
some sort of base angle. So okay local
some sort of base angle. So okay local
some sort of base angle. So okay local
base angle
base angle
base angle
and a value that I found that worked
and a value that I found that worked
and a value that I found that worked
well enough for me good enough for me is
well enough for me good enough for me is
well enough for me good enough for me is
45°.
45°.
45°.
And then we're going to make our base
And then we're going to make our base
And then we're going to make our base
angle here. Local base angle
angle here. Local base angle
angle here. Local base angle
is going to be equal to math.lurp. So
is going to be equal to math.lurp. So
is going to be equal to math.lurp. So
it's going to go between we're going to
it's going to go between we're going to
it's going to go between we're going to
go between
go between
go between
zero
zero
zero
and then base angle. So and the t value
and then base angle. So and the t value
and then base angle. So and the t value
is going to be progress. So math.lurp
is going to be progress. So math.lurp
is going to be progress. So math.lurp
basically when progress is zero we're
basically when progress is zero we're
basically when progress is zero we're
going to give you zero. When progress is
going to give you zero. When progress is
going to give you zero. When progress is
one we'll give you base angle. Anything
one we'll give you base angle. Anything
one we'll give you base angle. Anything
in between, anything in between 0 and
in between, anything in between 0 and
in between, anything in between 0 and
one, we give you a linear like inter
one, we give you a linear like inter
one, we give you a linear like inter
interpolation between zero and base
interpolation between zero and base
interpolation between zero and base
angle. So let's say progress is at 50%,
angle. So let's say progress is at 50%,
angle. So let's say progress is at 50%,
so we're at iteration, I don't know,
so we're at iteration, I don't know,
so we're at iteration, I don't know,
two. I guess there's no real 50%
two. I guess there's no real 50%
two. I guess there's no real 50%
progress. You get what I mean? So
progress. You get what I mean? So
progress. You get what I mean? So
iteration two, for example, it would be,
iteration two, for example, it would be,
iteration two, for example, it would be,
I don't know, like 20°. So the taller
I don't know, like 20°. So the taller
I don't know, like 20°. So the taller
you get in the tree, the more extreme
you get in the tree, the more extreme
you get in the tree, the more extreme
the base angle is going to get. And then
the base angle is going to get. And then
the base angle is going to get. And then
what we're going to do is we're going to
what we're going to do is we're going to
what we're going to do is we're going to
add some randomization to this base
add some randomization to this base
add some randomization to this base
angle. Say local variation

So
So
So
basically the more we go up the less
basically the more we go up the less
basically the more we go up the less
variation there is because we're doing
variation there is because we're doing
variation there is because we're doing
one minus progress. So when progress is
one minus progress. So when progress is
one minus progress. So when progress is
like one there's going to be like zero
like one there's going to be like zero
like one there's going to be like zero
variation but lower it is it's going to
variation but lower it is it's going to
variation but lower it is it's going to
be a little bit more variation. Again
be a little bit more variation. Again
be a little bit more variation. Again
this is kind of arbitary. I don't really
this is kind of arbitary. I don't really
this is kind of arbitary. I don't really
know what I'm doing, but it works well
know what I'm doing, but it works well
know what I'm doing, but it works well
enough. Then we're going to do our local

droop angle. That's my scientific name
droop angle. That's my scientific name
droop angle. That's my scientific name
for the angle at which the branches
for the angle at which the branches
for the angle at which the branches
droop down. I know it's great. Do base
droop down. I know it's great. Do base
droop down. I know it's great. Do base
angle and then we're going to multip or
angle and then we're going to multip or
angle and then we're going to multip or
we're going to add that to math.random
we're going to add that to math.random
we're going to add that to math.random
negative variation to variation. So this
negative variation to variation. So this
negative variation to variation. So this
just gives us a negative value between
just gives us a negative value between
just gives us a negative value between
like the two angles and degrees. But
like the two angles and degrees. But
like the two angles and degrees. But
since we're dealing with angles and
since we're dealing with angles and
since we're dealing with angles and
degrees, we're going to do math.rad
degrees, we're going to do math.rad
degrees, we're going to do math.rad
droop angle. This converts it into a
droop angle. This converts it into a
droop angle. This converts it into a
radian value. And so again, if it's
radian value. And so again, if it's
radian value. And so again, if it's
easier for you to work into degrees,
easier for you to work into degrees,
easier for you to work into degrees,
just always convert it to math. But all
just always convert it to math. But all
just always convert it to math. But all
these C frame functions, they all take
these C frame functions, they all take
these C frame functions, they all take
angles in radians. So just remember to

do that. So let's test that out. See how

We'll do one generation, but otherwise

We'll do one generation, but otherwise
we might want to like branch off

multiple times. So I'm going to create a

local chance variable. And this is again
local chance variable. And this is again
local chance variable. And this is again
pretty arbitrary, but works well enough.
pretty arbitrary, but works well enough.
pretty arbitrary, but works well enough.
So it's going to be math.max 0.1

But then we still give us like a chance

math domax probably isn't really
math domax probably isn't really
math domax probably isn't really

We need to generate the tree with the

again, we don't have to add any more to

tree height. We're just branching off in
tree height. We're just branching off in
tree height. We're just branching off in
a different direction. Then what we're
a different direction. Then what we're
a different direction. Then what we're
going to do is we're going to half the
going to do is we're going to half the

chance. So I'm going to do chance times
chance. So I'm going to do chance times
chance. So I'm going to do chance times
equals 0.5. So every single time we go
equals 0.5. So every single time we go
equals 0.5. So every single time we go
around it becomes half as likely to get

possible it's harder. Again, this chance
possible it's harder. Again, this chance
possible it's harder. Again, this chance

the higher you go up, the less chance
the higher you go up, the less chance

And then I'm going to reference it up
And then I'm going to reference it up

let's go get server storage.
let's go get server storage.

So, game get service server storage.
Then our local leaf complete
Then our local leaf complete
Then our local leaf complete
equals server storage.af. Cool. We got
equals server storage.af. Cool. We got
equals server storage.af. Cool. We got
our leaf. And then what we're going to
our leaf. And then what we're going to
our leaf. And then what we're going to
do is we're not going to spawn the leaf
do is we're not going to spawn the leaf
do is we're not going to spawn the leaf

Sort of like how a normal tree works.

It's more nuanced, but we're
approximating a tree. We're in We're in

approximating a tree. We're in We're in
Roblox anyway. So, we're going to do it
Roblox anyway. So, we're going to do it
Roblox anyway. So, we're going to do it
in the base case. So if you remember the
in the base case. So if you remember the
in the base case. So if you remember the
base case is where the like leaf or like
base case is where the like leaf or like
base case is where the like leaf or like
where like the tree stops. So it's going
where like the tree stops. So it's going
where like the tree stops. So it's going
to be at the tips up here and that's
to be at the tips up here and that's
to be at the tips up here and that's
exactly what we want. So we're before
exactly what we want. So we're before
exactly what we want. So we're before
this return statement we need to
this return statement we need to
this return statement we need to
actually do our leaf creation process.

So I'm going to say local leaf equals

So I'm going to say local leaf equals
leaf template clone. And now you're
leaf template clone. And now you're
leaf template clone. And now you're
going to notice why we have the pivot
going to notice why we have the pivot
going to notice why we have the pivot
and origin here because the leaf
and origin here because the leaf
and origin here because the leaf
actually needs the pivot and origin to
actually needs the pivot and origin to
actually needs the pivot and origin to
know where it should go. So we're going
know where it should go. So we're going
know where it should go. So we're going
to do leaf pivot 2
to do leaf pivot 2
to do leaf pivot 2
pivot times origin
pivot times origin
pivot times origin
and then
and then
and then
leaf size. We're going to randomize it.
leaf size. We're going to randomize it.
leaf size. We're going to randomize it.
So it's going to be equal to leaf size
So it's going to be equal to leaf size
So it's going to be equal to leaf size
times math domax
times math domax
times math domax
0.3. And then we're going to do
0.3. And then we're going to do
0.3. And then we're going to do
math.random. random
times
times
times
1.5. So basically um this is I don't

like bespoke math.random. So this
like bespoke math.random. So this
like bespoke math.random. So this
returns a value between 0 and one. We
returns a value between 0 and one. We
returns a value between 0 and one. We
scale that to 1.5. So it returns a value
scale that to 1.5. So it returns a value
scale that to 1.5. So it returns a value
between 0 and 1.5 now. And then we take
between 0 and 1.5 now. And then we take
between 0 and 1.5 now. And then we take
the max of that. So basically if it's
the max of that. So basically if it's
the max of that. So basically if it's
too low, we just clamp it to being 0.3.
too low, we just clamp it to being 0.3.
too low, we just clamp it to being 0.3.
