so a vector force in roblox studio is
so a vector force in roblox studio is
so a vector force in roblox studio is
a constraint that applies a force
a constraint that applies a force
a constraint that applies a force
in the direction of a vector
in the direction of a vector
in the direction of a vector
and it's the equivalent of a legacy
and it's the equivalent of a legacy
and it's the equivalent of a legacy
body force if you don't know what that
body force if you don't know what that
body force if you don't know what that
is that's fine but it was just it's an
is that's fine but it was just it's an
is that's fine but it was just it's an
old way of
old way of
old way of
applying a force to a part in roblox but
applying a force to a part in roblox but
applying a force to a part in roblox but
nowadays we use vector forces so
nowadays we use vector forces so
nowadays we use vector forces so
i'm going to make a part here here's my
i'm going to make a part here here's my
i'm going to make a part here here's my
part i'm going to move it up a little

there we go and the way you create a
there we go and the way you create a
there we go and the way you create a
vector force is go to
vector force is go to
vector force is go to
model then to create then go to
model then to create then go to
model then to create then go to
vector force so here i have this little
vector force so here i have this little
vector force so here i have this little
green thing this is your attachment

green thing this is your attachment
the arrow is where the default force
the arrow is where the default force
the arrow is where the default force
will be applied
will be applied
will be applied
so i'm just going to put my force right
so i'm just going to put my force right
so i'm just going to put my force right
there and
there and
there and
if you can't see your vector force make
if you can't see your vector force make
if you can't see your vector force make
sure to turn on constraint details draw

i guess i'll just leave it off like you
i guess i'll just leave it off like you
i guess i'll just leave it off like you
can see the difference there you go
can see the difference there you go
can see the difference there you go
so here's our vector force
so here's our vector force
so here's our vector force
and if we look at the properties here
and if we look at the properties here
and if we look at the properties here
are the basic properties and this arrow
are the basic properties and this arrow
are the basic properties and this arrow
just tells you where
just tells you where
just tells you where
it's going to go so i'm going to play
it's going to go so i'm going to play
it's going to go so i'm going to play
this just to show you
this just to show you
this just to show you
the vector force takes it that way so in
the vector force takes it that way so in
the vector force takes it that way so in
its default state without changing
its default state without changing
its default state without changing
anything about your force
anything about your force
anything about your force
no matter where you orient your part so
no matter where you orient your part so
no matter where you orient your part so
let me just
let me just
let me just
put it there it always goes in the
put it there it always goes in the
put it there it always goes in the
direction
direction
direction
of that arrow it does not change and
of that arrow it does not change and
of that arrow it does not change and
this is really useful
this is really useful
this is really useful
to make relative forces so let's
to make relative forces so let's
to make relative forces so let's
actually get into the force
actually get into the force
actually get into the force
here we go
here we go
here we go
and you can see there are a bunch of
and you can see there are a bunch of
and you can see there are a bunch of
properties so let's first start at this
properties so let's first start at this
properties so let's first start at this
force property this is a vector 3
force property this is a vector 3
force property this is a vector 3
telling you where the force is going to
telling you where the force is going to
telling you where the force is going to
go
go
go
in our vector force so you may be
in our vector force so you may be
in our vector force so you may be
looking at okay it's x y and z that's
looking at okay it's x y and z that's
looking at okay it's x y and z that's
pretty normal right you have
pretty normal right you have
pretty normal right you have
you know y's up and down and x is across
you know y's up and down and x is across
you know y's up and down and x is across
and z
and z
and z
is like front back but the x y and z
is like front back but the x y and z
is like front back but the x y and z
of this force are determined by
of this force are determined by
of this force are determined by
the primary and secondary axis of your
the primary and secondary axis of your
the primary and secondary axis of your
attachment zero so here's my attachment
attachment zero so here's my attachment
attachment zero so here's my attachment

you can see it right here the yellow
you can see it right here the yellow
you can see it right here the yellow
axis

the yellow arrow is the
the yellow arrow is the
the yellow arrow is the
primary axis which is also the x-axis
primary axis which is also the x-axis
primary axis which is also the x-axis
and the orange axis is the
and the orange axis is the
and the orange axis is the
y-axis so if i were to take my
y-axis so if i were to take my
y-axis so if i were to take my
attachment you can
attachment you can
attachment you can
position and orient an attachment just
position and orient an attachment just
position and orient an attachment just
like a normal
like a normal
like a normal
part if i were to take it and angle it
part if i were to take it and angle it
part if i were to take it and angle it
upward you can see the force
upward you can see the force
upward you can see the force
moves with it so let's just play this
it flips around because the force is
it flips around because the force is
it flips around because the force is
bringing it upwards
bringing it upwards
bringing it upwards
and this also brings up another point
and this also brings up another point
and this also brings up another point
the vector forces are applied on
the vector forces are applied on
the vector forces are applied on
attachment zero they're not applied
attachment zero they're not applied
attachment zero they're not applied
at the middle of your part they're
at the middle of your part they're
at the middle of your part they're
applied exactly on attachment zero
applied exactly on attachment zero
applied exactly on attachment zero
so this allows you with your body forces
so this allows you with your body forces
so this allows you with your body forces
let me just
let me just
let me just
move it this way this allows you to make
move it this way this allows you to make
move it this way this allows you to make
your part spin just by applying a force
your part spin just by applying a force
your part spin just by applying a force
so you can see when i play this
so you can see when i play this
so you can see when i play this
that the part spins because the arrow is
that the part spins because the arrow is
that the part spins because the arrow is
pointing that way
pointing that way
pointing that way
so it like pulls the part and since the
so it like pulls the part and since the
so it like pulls the part and since the
forces only be applied on the edge of
forces only be applied on the edge of
forces only be applied on the edge of
the part
the part
the part
it makes it turn and you can change this
it makes it turn and you can change this
it makes it turn and you can change this
behavior

in the properties tab so for example if
in the properties tab so for example if
in the properties tab so for example if
i want to
i want to
i want to
only apply the force in the center of
only apply the force in the center of
only apply the force in the center of
part or the center of mass i can just
part or the center of mass i can just
part or the center of mass i can just
check apply center of mass
check apply center of mass
check apply center of mass
and if i were to run this it would only
and if i were to run this it would only
and if i were to run this it would only
go forward
go forward
go forward
and also one big thing to note is this
and also one big thing to note is this
and also one big thing to note is this
relative to
relative to
relative to
property this basically just tells you
property this basically just tells you
property this basically just tells you
what the force should be applied
what the force should be applied
what the force should be applied
relative to

relative to
so usually i stick to attachment zero
so usually i stick to attachment zero
so usually i stick to attachment zero
and world you could do attachment one it
and world you could do attachment one it
and world you could do attachment one it
brings you another property there but
brings you another property there but
brings you another property there but
i just like to go with world sometimes
i just like to go with world sometimes
i just like to go with world sometimes
our attachment zero so the difference
our attachment zero so the difference
our attachment zero so the difference
between world and attachment zero
between world and attachment zero
between world and attachment zero
is the axes of our force
is the axes of our force
is the axes of our force
vector when you set it to world r and d
vector when you set it to world r and d
vector when you set it to world r and d
oriented to the world x y and z so if i
oriented to the world x y and z so if i
oriented to the world x y and z so if i
were to change it back to
were to change it back to
were to change it back to
attachment zero you can see the arrow
attachment zero you can see the arrow
attachment zero you can see the arrow
changes and if i were to change it back
changes and if i were to change it back
changes and if i were to change it back
to world
to world
to world
and like let's say i set it to zero and
and like let's say i set it to zero and
and like let's say i set it to zero and
i set y
i set y
i set y
to a thousand this would be pointing up
to a thousand this would be pointing up
to a thousand this would be pointing up
regardless of the orientation of the
regardless of the orientation of the
regardless of the orientation of the
part so if i were to
part so if i were to
part so if i were to
rotate the part you can see the vector
rotate the part you can see the vector
rotate the part you can see the vector
force is still pointing up no matter
force is still pointing up no matter
force is still pointing up no matter
where i rotate the part
where i rotate the part
where i rotate the part
and this can be useful in some
and this can be useful in some
and this can be useful in some
situations it just depends but
situations it just depends but
situations it just depends but
make sure if you just want a force like
make sure if you just want a force like
make sure if you just want a force like
going in a constant direction
going in a constant direction
going in a constant direction
you set it relative to to world that's
you set it relative to to world that's
you set it relative to to world that's
basically all you need to know

this sort of force thing
and so if i were to run this let me just
and so if i were to run this let me just
and so if i were to run this let me just
go back here if i were to run this
go back here if i were to run this
go back here if i were to run this
you can see the part does not move it
you can see the part does not move it
you can see the part does not move it
looks like it's anchored but just to
looks like it's anchored but just to
looks like it's anchored but just to
show you i'm going to go actually play
show you i'm going to go actually play
show you i'm going to go actually play
it
and so now if i were to hit the part you
and so now if i were to hit the part you
and so now if i were to hit the part you
can see it maintains all this momentum
can see it maintains all this momentum
can see it maintains all this momentum
and there's no air resistance in roblox
and there's no air resistance in roblox
and there's no air resistance in roblox
so it'll just keep on going like that
so it'll just keep on going like that
so it'll just keep on going like that
forever and one thing to note
forever and one thing to note
forever and one thing to note
about this is you can just multiply this
about this is you can just multiply this
about this is you can just multiply this
y value by whatever you want so i'm
y value by whatever you want so i'm
y value by whatever you want so i'm
going to say
going to say
going to say
0.5 so now the part has
0.5 so now the part has
0.5 so now the part has
half the gravity of earth
and then if you well i assume it's earth
and then if you well i assume it's earth
and then if you well i assume it's earth
it's just the default
it's just the default
it's just the default
gravity in the workspace and you can
gravity in the workspace and you can
gravity in the workspace and you can
also change this to like a bigger value
also change this to like a bigger value
also change this to like a bigger value
so it falls quicker
so it falls quicker
so it falls quicker
but you can do whatever you want with
