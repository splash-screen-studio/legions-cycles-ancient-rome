and let's get it started
so what exactly is a region 3 a region 3
so what exactly is a region 3 a region 3
so what exactly is a region 3 a region 3
is a rectangular prism
is a rectangular prism
is a rectangular prism
just like a part in roblox but unlike a
just like a part in roblox but unlike a
just like a part in roblox but unlike a
part a region's size and position are
part a region's size and position are
part a region's size and position are
defined by two vectors
defined by two vectors
defined by two vectors
the min and the max
the min and the max
the min and the max
and so basically let me let me show you
and so basically let me let me show you
and so basically let me let me show you
here
here
here
is our rectangular prism apart its
is our rectangular prism apart its
is our rectangular prism apart its
position
position
position
is defined by a point in the center so
is defined by a point in the center so
is defined by a point in the center so
like let's say right there
like let's say right there
like let's say right there
and its size is determined by a vector
and its size is determined by a vector
and its size is determined by a vector
that gives us
that gives us
that gives us
the length the height and
the length the height and
the length the height and
the width but in a region three
the width but in a region three
the width but in a region three
it's defined by the min vector and the
it's defined by the min vector and the
it's defined by the min vector and the
max vector so the min vector
max vector so the min vector
max vector so the min vector
would be around right here and the max
would be around right here and the max
would be around right here and the max
vector would be right
vector would be right
vector would be right
here so using these two vectors
here so using these two vectors
here so using these two vectors
you can basically already get the size
you can basically already get the size
you can basically already get the size
and the position of our region
and the position of our region
and the position of our region
the thing about using a minimum and a
the thing about using a minimum and a
the thing about using a minimum and a
maximum vector
maximum vector
maximum vector
is the fact that if you switch them up
is the fact that if you switch them up
is the fact that if you switch them up
or if you mix them up your region will
or if you mix them up your region will
or if you mix them up your region will
have a negative size and
have a negative size and
have a negative size and
a weird position so when you're making
a weird position so when you're making
a weird position so when you're making
your regions you always have to make
your regions you always have to make
your regions you always have to make
sure that your
sure that your
sure that your
minimum is your first vector and your
minimum is your first vector and your
minimum is your first vector and your
maximum is your second
maximum is your second
maximum is your second
so now let's go into roblox studio and
so now let's go into roblox studio and
so now let's go into roblox studio and
make a region
make a region
make a region
so usually in roblox you don't just make
so usually in roblox you don't just make
so usually in roblox you don't just make
a region using code using a min and a
a region using code using a min and a
a region using code using a min and a
max vector
max vector
max vector
you make a part that represents your
you make a part that represents your
you make a part that represents your
region and then you just make a region
region and then you just make a region
region and then you just make a region
around that part
around that part
around that part
so let me just make a quick little part
so let me just make a quick little part
so let me just make a quick little part
right here there we go i'm going to make
right here there we go i'm going to make
right here there we go i'm going to make
it
it
it
a little bit transparent i'm going to
a little bit transparent i'm going to
a little bit transparent i'm going to
anchor it and turn can collide off and
anchor it and turn can collide off and
anchor it and turn can collide off and
we're just going to name this my
we're just going to name this my
we're just going to name this my
re if i can spell it region part
re if i can spell it region part
re if i can spell it region part
there we go and i'm going to create a
there we go and i'm going to create a
there we go and i'm going to create a
script inside
script inside
script inside
of this part let me zoom in
of this part let me zoom in
of this part let me zoom in
this is going to be our
this is going to be our
this is going to be our
region script i'm just going to name it
region script i'm just going to name it
region script i'm just going to name it
region script
region script
region script
first thing i'm going to define is our
first thing i'm going to define is our
first thing i'm going to define is our
region part so local part will be equal
region part so local part will be equal
region part so local part will be equal
to script
to script
to script
dot parent and creating a region three
dot parent and creating a region three
dot parent and creating a region three
is actually pretty easy so let's just
is actually pretty easy so let's just
is actually pretty easy so let's just
disregard our part for a second so i can
disregard our part for a second so i can
disregard our part for a second so i can
define my region
define my region
define my region
as equal to region three
as equal to region three
as equal to region three
dot new and it takes in two vectors a
dot new and it takes in two vectors a
dot new and it takes in two vectors a
min
min
min
and a max so unlike a part if you were
and a max so unlike a part if you were
and a max so unlike a part if you were
to create a part you would give it a
to create a part you would give it a
to create a part you would give it a
position or c
position or c
position or c
frame and size with our region we have
frame and size with our region we have
frame and size with our region we have
to give it a minimum and a maximum
to give it a minimum and a maximum
to give it a minimum and a maximum
vector so in
vector so in
vector so in
roblox our min vector would be
roblox our min vector would be
roblox our min vector would be
like right there at the bottom left and
like right there at the bottom left and
like right there at the bottom left and
the max vector would be like right there
the max vector would be like right there
the max vector would be like right there
at the top
so let's go back into our script and
so let's go back into our script and
so let's go back into our script and
the way you would define this for our
the way you would define this for our
the way you would define this for our
part is by saying
the part dot position minus
the part dot position minus
the part dot position minus
the part dot size divided by two and the
the part dot size divided by two and the
the part dot size divided by two and the
part.position
part.position
part.position
plus let me zoom out the part dot
plus let me zoom out the part dot
plus let me zoom out the part dot
size divided by two so what this means
size divided by two so what this means
size divided by two so what this means
is
is
is
let me go back to my little picture
let me go back to my little picture
let me go back to my little picture
let me just make this smaller so this is
let me just make this smaller so this is
let me just make this smaller so this is
our part dot position
our part dot position
our part dot position
and we want to get the minimum and the
and we want to get the minimum and the
and we want to get the minimum and the
max with this position and with our size
max with this position and with our size
max with this position and with our size
so the way we do that
so the way we do that
so the way we do that
is we take the size and we divide it by
is we take the size and we divide it by
is we take the size and we divide it by
two so size would usually just be a
two so size would usually just be a
two so size would usually just be a
vector
vector
vector
that expands the whole rectangular prism
that expands the whole rectangular prism
that expands the whole rectangular prism
let's say
let's say
let's say
but if you divide it by two then we can
but if you divide it by two then we can
but if you divide it by two then we can
offset our position
offset our position
offset our position
either plus or minus by this so it'll
either plus or minus by this so it'll
either plus or minus by this so it'll
offset it by size divided by twos it'll
offset it by size divided by twos it'll
offset it by size divided by twos it'll
go here
go here
go here
to here for the minimum and then go from
to here for the minimum and then go from
to here for the minimum and then go from
here
here
here
to here for the maximum
and so if you were to just run this
nothing would happen because there's our
nothing would happen because there's our
nothing would happen because there's our
a few functions that we have to use to
a few functions that we have to use to
a few functions that we have to use to
actually make
actually make
actually make
our region 3 useful and the first one
our region 3 useful and the first one
our region 3 useful and the first one
is workspace find part and region three
is workspace find part and region three
is workspace find part and region three
so i'm going to say a local variable
so i'm going to say a local variable
so i'm going to say a local variable
parts and this is a list and it's going
parts and this is a list and it's going
parts and this is a list and it's going
to be equal to workspace
to be equal to workspace
to be equal to workspace
find part on region three
find part on region three
find part on region three
it's in region three my bad in region
it's in region three my bad in region
it's in region three my bad in region
three
three
three
find parts in region three and you just
find parts in region three and you just
find parts in region three and you just
send in the region let's just do that
send in the region let's just do that
send in the region let's just do that
for now
for now
for now
and if we were to loop through the parts
and pairs for i part and pairs
and pairs for i part and pairs
and pairs for i part and pairs
parts do print
parts do print
parts do print
part dot name let's just run this
part dot name let's just run this
part dot name let's just run this
so you can see our region is detecting
so you can see our region is detecting
so you can see our region is detecting
our base plate which is down here and
our base plate which is down here and
our base plate which is down here and
our region part
our region part
our region part
and our region part is just the part
and our region part is just the part
and our region part is just the part
that we use to define our region
that we use to define our region
that we use to define our region
so usually you don't want that to happen
so usually you don't want that to happen
so usually you don't want that to happen
you don't want
you don't want
you don't want
our region three to be detecting the
our region three to be detecting the
our region three to be detecting the
part that's supposed to
part that's supposed to
part that's supposed to
represent itself because that just
represent itself because that just
represent itself because that just
doesn't really make sense so the way
doesn't really make sense so the way
doesn't really make sense so the way
you'd get around this
you'd get around this
you'd get around this
is in the second parameter of this fine
is in the second parameter of this fine
is in the second parameter of this fine
parts and region 3 function
parts and region 3 function
parts and region 3 function
you would define a part which would be
you would define a part which would be
you would define a part which would be
the ignore descendants instance
the ignore descendants instance
the ignore descendants instance
so what that basically means is when our
so what that basically means is when our
so what that basically means is when our
region is searching for all the parts
region is searching for all the parts
region is searching for all the parts
within the
within the
within the
region of this like rectangular prism it
region of this like rectangular prism it
region of this like rectangular prism it
would ignore our region part
would ignore our region part
would ignore our region part
so if we were to run this you can see it
so if we were to run this you can see it
so if we were to run this you can see it
only detects the base plate
only detects the base plate
only detects the base plate
and now if you were if you want to set
and now if you were if you want to set
and now if you were if you want to set
this up for a player
this up for a player

each loop and then if we were to run
each loop and then if we were to run
each loop and then if we were to run
this with our player
you can see the loop's working well and
you can see the loop's working well and
you can see the loop's working well and
when i go into my
when i go into my
when i go into my
region you can see it detects where

out of the region it doesn't detect
out of the region it doesn't detect
out of the region it doesn't detect
anything it does detect the base plate

anything it does detect the base plate
and go back in it detects all of my body

get the player out of this you would
get the player out of this you would
get the player out of this you would
just

just
say local character equals game

part dot parent and then i'd say if
part dot parent and then i'd say if

print player dot name there we go so if
print player dot name there we go so if
print player dot name there we go so if
i were to run this
i were to run this
i were to run this
it should say nothing because the region
it should say nothing because the region
it should say nothing because the region
is not a player

ignore these errors this is just some
ignore these errors this is just some
ignore these errors this is just some
roblox stuff i think it has to do
roblox stuff i think it has to do
roblox stuff i think it has to do
with loading some textures or whatever
with loading some textures or whatever
with loading some textures or whatever
but when i go into my
but when i go into my
but when i go into my
region you can see it detects me but
region you can see it detects me but
region you can see it detects me but
since all of my body parts are in the
since all of my body parts are in the
since all of my body parts are in the
region
region
region
it detects me multiple times
but that should not be a problem for
but that should not be a problem for
but that should not be a problem for
most of your scripts
most of your scripts
most of your scripts
so region 3s and roblox are very useful
so region 3s and roblox are very useful
so region 3s and roblox are very useful
for detecting parts and detecting
for detecting parts and detecting
for detecting parts and detecting
players but one of the biggest uses
players but one of the biggest uses
players but one of the biggest uses
for our regions is making terrain
for our regions is making terrain
for our regions is making terrain
and so let's do that first i'm going to
and so let's do that first i'm going to
and so let's do that first i'm going to
comment out our infinite loop because we
comment out our infinite loop because we
comment out our infinite loop because we
don't want that messing up our code
don't want that messing up our code
don't want that messing up our code
and now i'm going to create our
and now i'm going to create our
and now i'm going to create our
terrain and before you create your
terrain and before you create your
terrain and before you create your
terrain you have to do
terrain you have to do
terrain you have to do
region equals region expand
region equals region expand
region equals region expand
to grid 4. so
to grid 4. so
to grid 4. so
what this basically does is it aligns
what this basically does is it aligns
what this basically does is it aligns
our region
our region
our region
with the native voxel based terrain
with the native voxel based terrain
with the native voxel based terrain
system and
system and
system and
roblox so if you don't know a voxel
roblox so if you don't know a voxel
roblox so if you don't know a voxel
is a basically a 3d pixel so a pixel is
is a basically a 3d pixel so a pixel is
is a basically a 3d pixel so a pixel is
like you know any point on your screen
like you know any point on your screen
like you know any point on your screen
a voxel is like a 3d pixel think of it
a voxel is like a 3d pixel think of it
a voxel is like a 3d pixel think of it
as a with a
as a with a
as a with a
like a part with a defined size
like a part with a defined size
like a part with a defined size
that is like a cube so each voxel on
that is like a cube so each voxel on
that is like a cube so each voxel on
roblox is
roblox is
roblox is
four by four by four studs and it's
four by four by four studs and it's
four by four by four studs and it's
used to generate terrain so when we
used to generate terrain so when we
used to generate terrain so when we
ought to create terrain using our region
ought to create terrain using our region
ought to create terrain using our region
it has to be aligned to this voxel grid
it has to be aligned to this voxel grid
it has to be aligned to this voxel grid
and that's exactly what this function
and that's exactly what this function
and that's exactly what this function
does so remember to use it
does so remember to use it
does so remember to use it
and then making the terrain is pretty
and then making the terrain is pretty
and then making the terrain is pretty
simple after that let's do
simple after that let's do
simple after that let's do
game.workspace.terrain and then you do
game.workspace.terrain and then you do
game.workspace.terrain and then you do
fill or region and it takes three
fill or region and it takes three
fill or region and it takes three
parameters the region
parameters the region
parameters the region
that you want to fill the resolution
that you want to fill the resolution
that you want to fill the resolution
the resolution should always be for i
the resolution should always be for i
the resolution should always be for i
don't know why it's a parameter but it
don't know why it's a parameter but it
don't know why it's a parameter but it
just
just
just
is so just always leave that to four and
is so just always leave that to four and
is so just always leave that to four and
then you have to set the material
then you have to set the material
then you have to set the material
enum dot material dot let's say grass
enum dot material dot let's say grass
enum dot material dot let's say grass
there we go so if we were to run this
there we go so if we were to run this
there we go so if we were to run this
you can see the textures take a little
you can see the textures take a little
you can see the textures take a little
while to load in but our region is now
while to load in but our region is now
while to load in but our region is now
filled
filled
filled
with grass and you can see it's not
with grass and you can see it's not
with grass and you can see it's not
necessarily
necessarily

conforming to our part our part is like
conforming to our part our part is like
conforming to our part our part is like
in there

in there
because it has had to expand to the grid
because it has had to expand to the grid
because it has had to expand to the grid
but that's how you generate terrain and
but that's how you generate terrain and
but that's how you generate terrain and
you can do whatever
you can do whatever
you can do whatever
material you want like i can do basalt
material you want like i can do basalt
material you want like i can do basalt
let's say
let's say
let's say
you have a nice stony look you can also
you have a nice stony look you can also
you have a nice stony look you can also
notice how it generates differently
notice how it generates differently
notice how it generates differently
that's pretty interesting
that's pretty interesting
that's pretty interesting
but yeah so that's about it for this
but yeah so that's about it for this
