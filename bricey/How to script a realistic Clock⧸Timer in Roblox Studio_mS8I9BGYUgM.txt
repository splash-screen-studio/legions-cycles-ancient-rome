set the x position the first value there
set the x position the first value there
set the x position the first value there
2.5 so now it's centered and it's

through to come up with these
through to come up with these
through to come up with these
equations so we're going to first start
equations so we're going to first start

with finding the
with finding the
with finding the
minutes so i have this base number
minutes so i have this base number
minutes so i have this base number
100.654 seconds
100.654 seconds
100.654 seconds
and in order to find the minutes it's
and in order to find the minutes it's
and in order to find the minutes it's
actually pretty straightforward we just
actually pretty straightforward we just
actually pretty straightforward we just
divide by 60
divide by 60
divide by 60
because there are 60 seconds in a minute
because there are 60 seconds in a minute
because there are 60 seconds in a minute
so we need to get rid of seconds and
so we need to get rid of seconds and
so we need to get rid of seconds and
turn it into minutes
turn it into minutes
turn it into minutes
but we get a weird number so let me just
but we get a weird number so let me just

bring

this will give us one point

seven about and that's a decimal minutes
seven about and that's a decimal minutes
seven about and that's a decimal minutes
are whole numbers

so what we do is we floor it and that

basically
basically
basically
gets rid of the decimal values it brings
gets rid of the decimal values it brings
gets rid of the decimal values it brings
it down like it automatically rounds

we use do something a little bit

to get the remainder after we get our

100 divided by 60 will give us one like
100 divided by 60 will give us one like
100 divided by 60 will give us one like
whatever

and then what we can do to get seconds
and then what we can do to get seconds
and then what we can do to get seconds
is we can just say 1

take 60 subtract it from this value
take 60 subtract it from this value
take 60 subtract it from this value
and that'll give us our seconds so if i
and that'll give us our seconds so if i
and that'll give us our seconds so if i
bring up the calculator once again
bring up the calculator once again
bring up the calculator once again
we can say 100.654
we can say 100.654
we can say 100.654
divided by 60
not divided i meant to say minus let's
not divided i meant to say minus let's
not divided i meant to say minus let's
do it again
do it again
do it again
minus 60 will give us 40.654

now we're at 1 minute and 40 seconds
now we're at 1 minute and 40 seconds
now we're at 1 minute and 40 seconds
and you can see how instead of just

is divide by one or

do modulus by 1 to get that remainder
do modulus by 1 to get that remainder
do modulus by 1 to get that remainder
and since 1 goes into 100.654 100 times
and since 1 goes into 100.654 100 times
and since 1 goes into 100.654 100 times
we get a remainder of 0.654
we get a remainder of 0.654
we get a remainder of 0.654
and this isolates our decimal values

which is really really nice but if we

it would look really weird it'd be like

zero zero let me just

so what we do is we can multiply this by

and this would give us 65.4

and then we floor it to get rid of the

and this gives us 65 hundredths i'm just

our start timer function is basically

it does not stop so we need to fix that

that's a bad idea so i'm going to go to

i can just replace this

prevents us from having a typo

because the interpreter will realize

instead of just a string typo we'll have

is by adding a bindable event

after the timer finishes
so the timer starts going down as per
