so in front of me i have two parts one
so in front of me i have two parts one
so in front of me i have two parts one
of which

is the platform for elevator and the
next is our little
next is our little
next is our little
where our elevator will slide on so
where our elevator will slide on so
where our elevator will slide on so
the way we're going to make our elevator
the way we're going to make our elevator
the way we're going to make our elevator
is by using prismatic
is by using prismatic
is by using prismatic
constraints of course so i'm going to go
constraints of course so i'm going to go
constraints of course so i'm going to go
to model

alignment issue because
alignment issue because
alignment issue because
both the attachments and our
both the attachments and our
both the attachments and our
prismatic constraint have to be
prismatic constraint have to be
prismatic constraint have to be
their x-axis so their yellow axis is
their x-axis so their yellow axis is
their x-axis so their yellow axis is
they have to be aligned
they have to be aligned
they have to be aligned
but they're slider axis which in this

so wherever they're pointing is where
our prismatic
our prismatic
our prismatic
constraint can slide and that's all a
constraint can slide and that's all a
constraint can slide and that's all a
prismatic constraint does it allows
prismatic constraint does it allows
prismatic constraint does it allows
your two attachments to slide along one
your two attachments to slide along one
your two attachments to slide along one
axis no rotation whatsoever
axis no rotation whatsoever
axis no rotation whatsoever
but and they can't really move in
but and they can't really move in
but and they can't really move in
other axises either so let's go move
other axises either so let's go move
other axises either so let's go move
this
this
this
into position so the attachments are
into position so the attachments are
into position so the attachments are
both in the same slot
both in the same slot
both in the same slot
so if i were to press play
so if i were to press play
so if i were to press play
you can see that the part falls
you can see that the part falls
you can see that the part falls
if i move it up it does not move
if i move it up it does not move
if i move it up it does not move
away from like the central axis so i can
away from like the central axis so i can
away from like the central axis so i can
move it away it just stays there
move it away it just stays there
move it away it just stays there
so it's constrained to
so it's constrained to
so it's constrained to
this one axis of the pole and that's
this one axis of the pole and that's
this one axis of the pole and that's
exactly what you want with your
exactly what you want with your
exactly what you want with your
prismatic constraint
prismatic constraint

so just like a hinge constraint if you
so just like a hinge constraint if you
so just like a hinge constraint if you
didn't see my video on that make sure to

a prismatic constraint has a few
a prismatic constraint has a few
a prismatic constraint has a few
properties that you can change that
properties that you can change that
properties that you can change that
allow it to do like different things
allow it to do like different things
allow it to do like different things
and these look familiar you have limits
and these look familiar you have limits
and these look familiar you have limits
you have actuator type
you have actuator type
you have actuator type
and they're just both for what they are
and they're just both for what they are
and they're just both for what they are
for the hinge constraint
for the hinge constraint
for the hinge constraint
so if i enable limits real quick
so if i enable limits real quick
so if i enable limits real quick
the limits start according to
the limits start according to
the limits start according to
the attachment zero i believe
the attachment zero i believe
the attachment zero i believe
yep that's the attachment zero
and they basically are just the amount
and they basically are just the amount
and they basically are just the amount
of studs
of studs
of studs
where the prismatic constraint can move
where the prismatic constraint can move
where the prismatic constraint can move
so right now the limits are
so right now the limits are
so right now the limits are
lower limbs zero upper limits five and
lower limbs zero upper limits five and
lower limbs zero upper limits five and
they're defined by these little like
they're defined by these little like
they're defined by these little like
yellow things if you don't see that make
yellow things if you don't see that make
yellow things if you don't see that make
sure to go to model
sure to go to model
sure to go to model
constraint details draw on top and right
constraint details draw on top and right
constraint details draw on top and right
now if we were to play this
now if we were to play this
now if we were to play this
this won't move because the limits are
this won't move because the limits are
this won't move because the limits are
set accordingly
set accordingly
set accordingly
but for this elevator i'm just going to
but for this elevator i'm just going to
but for this elevator i'm just going to
set my lower limit
set my lower limit
set my lower limit
to negative 10 let's actually set it to
to negative 10 let's actually set it to

20. there we go that's about good and my
20. there we go that's about good and my
20. there we go that's about good and my
upper limit to zero
upper limit to zero
upper limit to zero
so it won't be able to go above the
so it won't be able to go above the
so it won't be able to go above the
upper limit and it'll stop at the lower
upper limit and it'll stop at the lower
upper limit and it'll stop at the lower
limit so right now you can see
limit so right now you can see
limit so right now you can see
it stops right there which is exactly
it stops right there which is exactly
it stops right there which is exactly
what we want
what we want

and you can also add some restitution so
and you can also add some restitution so
and you can also add some restitution so
it bounces i'm just going to do
it bounces i'm just going to do
it bounces i'm just going to do
0.5 let's see how that works you see it
0.5 let's see how that works you see it
0.5 let's see how that works you see it
sort of bounces

sort of bounces
at the bottom so you can change that to

whatever you want
whatever you want

now we have our actuator type so in this
now we have our actuator type so in this
now we have our actuator type so in this

we're going to use a servo
we're going to use a servo
we're going to use a servo
and the server will basically move our

and the server will basically move our
elevator platform to whatever position
elevator platform to whatever position
elevator platform to whatever position
we define so my target position right
we define so my target position right
we define so my target position right
now and this uses the same positioning
now and this uses the same positioning
now and this uses the same positioning
system as our upper and lower limit
system as our upper and lower limit
system as our upper and lower limit
so right now you can see the current
so right now you can see the current
so right now you can see the current
position is at zero
position is at zero
position is at zero
but we want to set our position let's
but we want to set our position let's
but we want to set our position let's
say let's set it to
negative 10
negative 10
negative 10
and you can see it's indicated by this

let me just turn on constraint detail so
let me just turn on constraint detail so
let me just turn on constraint detail so
i can change it mid game real quick
i can change it mid game real quick

at the very bottom and i'm going to move
the whole platform
the whole platform
the whole platform
plus the clicker down

i'm going to make a boolean variable
i'm going to make a boolean variable
i'm going to make a boolean variable
this will be up
this will be up
this will be up
up will be equal to false so this
up will be equal to false so this
up will be equal to false so this
elevator is going to be simple it's only
elevator is going to be simple it's only
elevator is going to be simple it's only
going to have two fours
going to have two fours
going to have two fours
up and down and so i can just set it as
up and down and so i can just set it as
up and down and so i can just set it as
a boolean you could obviously make this
a boolean you could obviously make this
a boolean you could obviously make this
a number that's the beauty of the servo
a number that's the beauty of the servo
a number that's the beauty of the servo
because you could set the target
because you could set the target
because you could set the target
position
position
position
to an increment of like 10 so target
to an increment of like 10 so target
to an increment of like 10 so target
position negative 20 target position
position negative 20 target position
position negative 20 target position
negative 10 and then target position
negative 10 and then target position
negative 10 and then target position

you just do that do whatever you want
you just do that do whatever you want
you just do that do whatever you want
and your click detector will just like

so up will be equal to false then we're
so up will be equal to false then we're

going to set click detector
going to set click detector
going to set click detector
dot mouse click and this will be an

do in this
do in this
do in this
event is set up equal to not up
event is set up equal to not up
event is set up equal to not up
so this will set if up is false up will
so this will set if up is false up will
so this will set if up is false up will
be set to true
be set to true
be set to true
if up is true then up will be set to
if up is true then up will be set to
if up is true then up will be set to
false and then all we need to do is just
false and then all we need to do is just
false and then all we need to do is just
set the target position
set the target position
set the target position
so pc dot target position
so pc dot target position
so pc dot target position
will be equal to up
will be equal to up
will be equal to up
and 0 or

negative 20. so this is another wacky
negative 20. so this is another wacky
negative 20. so this is another wacky
sort of logic statement basically what
sort of logic statement basically what
sort of logic statement basically what
this means is if uh
this means is if uh
this means is if uh
if up is true we're setting the target
if up is true we're setting the target
if up is true we're setting the target
position to zero which is at the very

top
top

but if up is false then we set it to
but if up is false then we set it to
but if up is false then we set it to
negative 20 which is what it's at
negative 20 which is what it's at
negative 20 which is what it's at
right now and by the way if you are
right now and by the way if you are
