or maybe some other 3D stuff in Roblox

and in other domains you will have to
and in other domains you will have to

use a normal they're incredibly useful

they're the like the same word but we're
they're the like the same word but we're
they're the like the same word but we're
going to talk about normal vectors today
going to talk about normal vectors today
going to talk about normal vectors today
so what is a normal Vector let's say you
so what is a normal Vector let's say you
so what is a normal Vector let's say you
have a plane in 3D space this is like
have a plane in 3D space this is like
have a plane in 3D space this is like
all the three axes so this is your plane
all the three axes so this is your plane
all the three axes so this is your plane
and the plane has a normal Vector its
and the plane has a normal Vector its
and the plane has a normal Vector its
normal would be kind of like this so
normal would be kind of like this so
normal would be kind of like this so
This drawing kind of sucks because I'm a
This drawing kind of sucks because I'm a
This drawing kind of sucks because I'm a
bad drawer but the whole idea here is a
bad drawer but the whole idea here is a
bad drawer but the whole idea here is a
normal Vector is a vector that is
normal Vector is a vector that is
normal Vector is a vector that is
perpendicular to the plane now we draw
perpendicular to the plane now we draw
perpendicular to the plane now we draw
it like an arrow like here because it it
it like an arrow like here because it it
it like an arrow like here because it it
points the direction but a normal is
points the direction but a normal is
points the direction but a normal is
nothing more than a direction if you
nothing more than a direction if you
nothing more than a direction if you
were to like actually plot the normal on
were to like actually plot the normal on
were to like actually plot the normal on
three axes on its own it would literally
three axes on its own it would literally
three axes on its own it would literally
just be a a vector could be here could
just be a a vector could be here could
just be a a vector could be here could
be there could be wherever but we draw
be there could be wherever but we draw
be there could be wherever but we draw
it on top of the plane to make it like
it on top of the plane to make it like
it on top of the plane to make it like
so that like that's the plane's
so that like that's the plane's
so that like that's the plane's
Direction and use normals to define a
Direction and use normals to define a
Direction and use normals to define a
plane because there's
plane because there's
plane because there's
only like three vectors that you can
only like three vectors that you can
only like three vectors that you can
like deal with in in 3D space to like
like deal with in in 3D space to like
like deal with in in 3D space to like
make things relative to other things you
make things relative to other things you
make things relative to other things you
have like the normal vector and then you
have like the normal vector and then you
have like the normal vector and then you
have like the two other vectors on the
have like the two other vectors on the
have like the two other vectors on the
plane actually let's draw this in
plane actually let's draw this in
plane actually let's draw this in
different color so you have like the two
different color so you have like the two
different color so you have like the two
other vectors on the plane like this but
other vectors on the plane like this but
other vectors on the plane like this but
it's easier to define a plane using this
it's easier to define a plane using this
it's easier to define a plane using this
one normal Vector as opposed to the two
one normal Vector as opposed to the two
one normal Vector as opposed to the two
other vectors because they have to be
other vectors because they have to be
other vectors because they have to be
orthonormal meaning like they're
orthonormal meaning like they're
orthonormal meaning like they're
perpendicular and they have to be like
perpendicular and they have to be like

unit vectors yeah a normal Vector
