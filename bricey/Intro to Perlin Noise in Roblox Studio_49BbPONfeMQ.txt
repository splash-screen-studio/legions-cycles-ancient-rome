this part you would get something

it would be something like this and then
it would be something like this and then
it would be something like this and then
maybe

it would do another one of those
and then go back up again so you get the

now it may be a little misleading

the z goes across the x goes across and

the y's up and down so we want to

the purlin noise return value that we

we can set our y value to our part to

since we're starting with y and then

so now we can define our noise

using a function

math.noise and this function takes in

x y and z since we're dealing with the

so you may be we may want to just say
so you may be we may want to just say

x y zero but
x y zero but
x y zero but
that would not work because if all of
that would not work because if all of
that would not work because if all of
these values are integers
these values are integers
these values are integers
math.noise will return zero so you have
math.noise will return zero so you have
math.noise will return zero so you have
to return a fractional value
to return a fractional value
to return a fractional value
and the easiest way to do that is by
and the easiest way to do that is by
and the easiest way to do that is by
saying x
saying x
saying x
divided by rows and then y
divided by rows and then y
divided by rows and then y
divided by calls so we get a fractional

divided by calls so we get a fractional
value so

if we're at our middle of our iteration
if we're at our middle of our iteration
if we're at our middle of our iteration
so let's say x is 50 we'll get
so let's say x is 50 we'll get
so let's say x is 50 we'll get
0.5 because 50 divided by 100 would be
0.5 because 50 divided by 100 would be
0.5 because 50 divided by 100 would be
0.5
0.5
0.5
and our math.noise will return a random

so then we can say create part
so then we can say create part
so then we can say create part
with our x our y and our noise value
with our x our y and our noise value
with our x our y and our noise value
so this should work fine let's try it
oh well i actually forgot to set

the part dot parent to the workspace

that's my bad here we go again we also

part dot anchored equal to true

so here you go here is your purlin noise
so here you go here is your purlin noise
so here you go here is your purlin noise
so you'll notice
so you'll notice
so you'll notice
that it's very very smooth
that it's very very smooth
that it's very very smooth
and each part is very close to each

other in terms of their

i get the same exact
i get the same exact
i get the same exact

so the way we'd go about adding
so the way we'd go about adding
so the way we'd go about adding
some randomness to our noise instead of

it being a constant same thing every

is by adding an offset so i'm going to

go to top my script to find

offset x which will be equal to let's

say 10
say 10
say 10
and an offset y which will be equal to
and an offset y which will be equal to
and an offset y which will be equal to
10 as well so these values will be
10 as well so these values will be
10 as well so these values will be
responsible for offsetting
responsible for offsetting
responsible for offsetting
our noise values so if we go down to
our noise values so if we go down to

math.noise
math.noise
math.noise
we can use the same expression here
we can use the same expression here
we can use the same expression here
x divided by rows but we can add our
x divided by rows but we can add our

so what this will do is basically just
so what this will do is basically just
so what this will do is basically just
shift the like sample values that we're
shift the like sample values that we're
shift the like sample values that we're
getting from
getting from
getting from
math.noise to our offset values and we
math.noise to our offset values and we
math.noise to our offset values and we
can do the same
can do the same
can do the same
for the columns with the offset y
for the columns with the offset y
for the columns with the offset y
and you'll notice if i run this it's
and you'll notice if i run this it's
and you'll notice if i run this it's
kind of hard to tell
kind of hard to tell
kind of hard to tell
but we get a slightly different noise

and this isn't completely random yet but
and this isn't completely random yet but
and this isn't completely random yet but
the there's a very easy way to do that
the there's a very easy way to do that
the there's a very easy way to do that
and that's by randomizing the offset
and that's by randomizing the offset
and that's by randomizing the offset
so i can just say offset x equals

from negative 100 to 100 and
from negative 100 to 100 and
from negative 100 to 100 and
i can copy this to offset y
i can copy this to offset y
i can copy this to offset y
so if i were to run this you can see we

that's exactly what we want now there's
