Placer toggle grid toggle grid so this
Placer toggle grid toggle grid so this
Placer toggle grid toggle grid so this
will toggle the Grid on and off and then

all we care about is the state so I'm
all we care about is the state so I'm
all we care about is the state so I'm
just put underscores and all the other
just put underscores and all the other
just put underscores and all the other

like up to you to decide what you want
like up to you to decide what you want
like up to you to decide what you want
to do so basically what this does is we
to do so basically what this does is we
to do so basically what this does is we
uh look at the current grid size if it's
uh look at the current grid size if it's
uh look at the current grid size if it's
zero then we set it to one if it's one
zero then we set it to one if it's one
zero then we set it to one if it's one
then we set it to zero so it just
then we set it to zero so it just
then we set it to zero so it just
toggles it from zero to one so when the
toggles it from zero to one so when the
toggles it from zero to one so when the
grid size is zero it's not going to snap
grid size is zero it's not going to snap
grid size is zero it's not going to snap
to grid when grid size is anything
to grid when grid size is anything
to grid when grid size is anything
greater than zero it'll snap to
greater than zero it'll snap to
greater than zero it'll snap to
whichever grid size that we have and so

if you wanted to make this like a cycle
if you wanted to make this like a cycle
if you wanted to make this like a cycle
grids like you know could do 0. 2551

whatever you could do the same idea that
whatever you could do the same idea that
whatever you could do the same idea that
we have cycle object up here and just
we have cycle object up here and just
we have cycle object up here and just
kind of do that for the grid side so you
kind of do that for the grid side so you
kind of do that for the grid side so you
like you spam G to get a bunch of
like you spam G to get a bunch of
like you spam G to get a bunch of
different grid sizes but for now this is
different grid sizes but for now this is
different grid sizes but for now this is
what we're going to
what we're going to
what we're going to
do and then

going forward we need to go to
going forward we need to go to
going forward we need to go to
the render preview so in render preview
the render preview so in render preview
the render preview so in render preview
we want to add a new local variable say
we want to add a new local variable say
we want to add a new local variable say
local position equals if self. grid size
local position equals if self. grid size
local position equals if self. grid size
is greater than zero then we want to
is greater than zero then we want to
is greater than zero then we want to
snap to grid which is a function that we
snap to grid which is a function that we
snap to grid which is a function that we
haven't implemented yet and we want to
haven't implemented yet and we want to
haven't implemented yet and we want to
pass in the cast. position and then the
pass in the cast. position and then the
pass in the cast. position and then the
self. grid size and then else we want to
self. grid size and then else we want to
self. grid size and then else we want to
just send them the cast. position so
just send them the cast. position so
just send them the cast. position so
this local position is just going to
this local position is just going to
this local position is just going to
replace our cast. position inside the CF
replace our cast. position inside the CF
replace our cast. position inside the CF
frame. new so it'll be cast stop
frame. new so it'll be cast stop
frame. new so it'll be cast stop
position when grid snapping is off I.E
position when grid snapping is off I.E
position when grid snapping is off I.E
grid size is zero otherwise we want to
grid size is zero otherwise we want to
grid size is zero otherwise we want to
actually snap it to grid so let's go
actually snap it to grid so let's go
actually snap it to grid so let's go
make that function and we're making this
make that function and we're making this
make that function and we're making this
a local function just because it's a
a local function just because it's a
a local function just because it's a
pure math function we're just doing some
pure math function we're just doing some
pure math function we're just doing some
math to a vector you could obviously
math to a vector you could obviously
math to a vector you could obviously
make it an actual class function if you
make it an actual class function if you
make it an actual class function if you
really wanted to but it's up to you and
really wanted to but it's up to you and
really wanted to but it's up to you and
so this will take in a position and then
so this will take in a position and then
so this will take in a position and then
a grid side
a grid side
a grid side
so what we basically want to do here is
so what we basically want to do here is
so what we basically want to do here is
return a new Vector 3 so Vector 3. new
return a new Vector 3 so Vector 3. new
return a new Vector 3 so Vector 3. new
and then ins size of here we want to I'm
and then ins size of here we want to I'm
and then ins size of here we want to I'm
just going to put a new line to make
just going to put a new line to make
just going to put a new line to make
some space we want to snap it to G so
some space we want to snap it to G so
some space we want to snap it to G so
what does that mean so there's a bunch
what does that mean so there's a bunch
what does that mean so there's a bunch
of different ways that you can do this
of different ways that you can do this
of different ways that you can do this
but the way that I'm going to do this is
but the way that I'm going to do this is
but the way that I'm going to do this is
using
using
using
math.round with the pause. x divided by
math.round with the pause. x divided by
math.round with the pause. x divided by
the grid size and then
the grid size and then
the grid size and then
times the grid size so what we're
times the grid size so what we're
times the grid size so what we're
basically doing here is let's say you
basically doing here is let's say you
basically doing here is let's say you
have a position like 6.5 and then you
have a position like 6.5 and then you
have a position like 6.5 and then you
have your grid size which is like two so
have your grid size which is like two so
have your grid size which is like two so
um 6.5 divided two is like actually
um 6.5 divided two is like actually
um 6.5 divided two is like actually
let's bring out a calculator I don't
let's bring out a calculator I don't
let's bring out a calculator I don't
know this math off 6.5 divided by 2 is
know this math off 6.5 divided by 2 is
know this math off 6.5 divided by 2 is
3.25 so 3.25 and then we round it so
3.25 so 3.25 and then we round it so
3.25 so 3.25 and then we round it so
math out round 3.25 would be three so
math out round 3.25 would be three so
math out round 3.25 would be three so
three is like the grid snapped position
three is like the grid snapped position
three is like the grid snapped position
that we have but we divided it by the
that we have but we divided it by the
that we have but we divided it by the
grid size so now we need to scale it up
grid size so now we need to scale it up
grid size so now we need to scale it up
by the grid size once again which is two
by the grid size once again which is two
by the grid size once again which is two
so it's going to be six so because it's
so it's going to be six so because it's
so it's going to be six so because it's
2 * 3 so let's just do that again from
2 * 3 so let's just do that again from
2 * 3 so let's just do that again from
the top so it would be 6.5 / 2 which is
the top so it would be 6.5 / 2 which is
the top so it would be 6.5 / 2 which is
3 and we want to floor that so it's 3 *
3 and we want to floor that so it's 3 *
3 and we want to floor that so it's 3 *
grid size which is two which is just six
grid size which is two which is just six
grid size which is two which is just six
so 6.25 gets rounded down to six and
so 6.25 gets rounded down to six and
so 6.25 gets rounded down to six and
then something like 7.5 so 7.5 divided
then something like 7.5 so 7.5 divided
then something like 7.5 so 7.5 divided
by two would give us 3.25 3.75 which
by two would give us 3.25 3.75 which
by two would give us 3.25 3.75 which
rounded up gives us 4 4 * 2 is 8 so it'd
rounded up gives us 4 4 * 2 is 8 so it'd
rounded up gives us 4 4 * 2 is 8 so it'd
be anywhere from like 6 to 8 on the X so
be anywhere from like 6 to 8 on the X so
be anywhere from like 6 to 8 on the X so
just by like playing with that you can
just by like playing with that you can
just by like playing with that you can
see how it's a good grid snapping
see how it's a good grid snapping
see how it's a good grid snapping
function and so for the Y we can just do
function and so for the Y we can just do
function and so for the Y we can just do
pause. y because we don't want to
pause. y because we don't want to
pause. y because we don't want to
actually change the Y position all we
actually change the Y position all we
actually change the Y position all we
want to do is change the x and z
want to do is change the x and z
want to do is change the x and z
position since we're dealing with a 2d
position since we're dealing with a 2d

plane where all of our like furniture
plane where all of our like furniture
plane where all of our like furniture
and you know walls are going to be
and you know walls are going to be
and you know walls are going to be
placed and then for these Z we do the
placed and then for these Z we do the
placed and then for these Z we do the
same exact thing as X so pause. Z / grid
same exact thing as X so pause. Z / grid
same exact thing as X so pause. Z / grid
size times grid size so we basically
size times grid size so we basically
size times grid size so we basically
find like the grid increment so we
find like the grid increment so we
find like the grid increment so we
basically make this pause. Z relative to
basically make this pause. Z relative to
basically make this pause. Z relative to
the grid size and then we find like
the grid size and then we find like
the grid size and then we find like
whether or not be like like zero or one
whether or not be like like zero or one
whether or not be like like zero or one
basically relative to that grid size and
basically relative to that grid size and
basically relative to that grid size and
then we scale it back up again we scale
then we scale it back up again we scale
then we scale it back up again we scale
it down and we scale it up but in
it down and we scale it up but in
it down and we scale it up but in
between we round it
between we round it
between we round it
so now we can use this snap to grid
so now we can use this snap to grid
so now we can use this snap to grid
