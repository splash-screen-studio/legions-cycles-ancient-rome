how is it taking you

over six months to get
over six months to get

submarines to have missiles because it's

been six months since the last devlog

well that's a long story and we'll get
well that's a long story and we'll get
well that's a long story and we'll get
to that a little bit later but for now

let's talk about these missiles so you
let's talk about these missiles so you
let's talk about these missiles so you
may remember back in november i think i

made a video on

made a video on
icbms like intercontinental ballistic
icbms like intercontinental ballistic

missiles and that is mainly for
missiles and that is mainly for
missiles and that is mainly for
uh the submarine game so i made that in
uh the submarine game so i made that in
uh the submarine game so i made that in
a separate place just like play around
a separate place just like play around
a separate place just like play around
with the code and make something that

works and now i have something

and submarine warfare that largely

so i can launch them real quick

you can see

they all launch from the things and i

which is cool and i can see it detonate

right now they're all targeted on this

little test sphere

because eventually i want to add some
because eventually i want to add some
because eventually i want to add some
targets that i can hit
targets that i can hit
targets that i can hit
like a bunker or a ship or something
like a bunker or a ship or something

and it will do damage to it and
and it will do damage to it and
and it will do damage to it and
eventually we'll have better vfx for the

but for now it's just a test of the

i think turned out pretty cool

so the way the whole thing works is that
so the way the whole thing works is that
so the way the whole thing works is that
each of these little hatches is a hinge
each of these little hatches is a hinge
each of these little hatches is a hinge
constraint and i can set the target

angle of that hinge constraint i have a

looks really freaking cool so that's the

have a nice arc trajectory where they

so they're not always guaranteed to land

it should still work out just fine

because you're launching 12 you you
