this is a little bit simpler
this is a little bit simpler
this is a little bit simpler
and roblox this will obviously be 3d

one on the x
one on the x
0 on the y and this would be my new
0 on the y and this would be my new

point and if 1 0 in world space would
point and if 1 0 in world space would
point and if 1 0 in world space would
just be

out of the way let's go into roblox
out of the way let's go into roblox
out of the way let's go into roblox
studio and

representation we're going to use this
representation we're going to use this
representation we're going to use this
part to represent our c frame
part to represent our c frame
part to represent our c frame
since all parts in roblox have a c frame
since all parts in roblox have a c frame
since all parts in roblox have a c frame
which is their position
which is their position
which is their position
and their orientation so i'm going to go
and their orientation so i'm going to go

create a part
a script i should say inside of my part

so we're going to define local new parts
so we're going to define local new parts
so we're going to define local new parts
equals instance dot new parts

new part dot size equals vector 3.0 1 1
new part dot size equals vector 3.0 1 1
new part dot size equals vector 3.0 1 1
1 just make it a little small cube and
1 just make it a little small cube and

we can return
we can return
we can return
new part there we go it's vector three
new part there we go it's vector three
new part there we go it's vector three
not vector three two whoops okay so here
not vector three two whoops okay so here
not vector three two whoops okay so here
we go
we go
we go
now let's make a new c frame
now let's make a new c frame
now let's make a new c frame
and convert it from world space
object space to world space so we're
object space to world space so we're
object space to world space so we're
going to start with
going to start with
going to start with
two world space as our first function
two world space as our first function
two world space as our first function
and this function
and this function
and this function
takes into c frame and it turns it into
takes into c frame and it turns it into
takes into c frame and it turns it into
world space from object space so we're
world space from object space so we're
world space from object space so we're
going to define a c frame and this c
going to define a c frame and this c
going to define a c frame and this c
frame is going to be equal to
frame is going to be equal to
frame is going to be equal to
c frame dot new zero zero
c frame dot new zero zero
c frame dot new zero zero
one so in world space this would just be
one so in world space this would just be
one so in world space this would just be
like one on the z axis but if we use
like one on the z axis but if we use
like one on the z axis but if we use
our part c frame like so so local
our part c frame like so so local
our part c frame like so so local
new c frame this will be equal to part
new c frame this will be equal to part
new c frame this will be equal to part
dot c frame colon to
dot c frame colon to
dot c frame colon to
world space and then
world space and then
world space and then
we give it the cf so this basically says
we give it the cf so this basically says
we give it the cf so this basically says
we take this c frame we convert it from
we take this c frame we convert it from
we take this c frame we convert it from
this basic default world space and we
this basic default world space and we
this basic default world space and we
move it relative to our part c frame
move it relative to our part c frame
move it relative to our part c frame
so if we were to create a part local
so if we were to create a part local
so if we were to create a part local
part equals create
part equals create
part equals create
part part dot c frame
part part dot c frame
part part dot c frame
equals new c frame if you were to run
equals new c frame if you were to run
equals new c frame if you were to run
this

you can see that this part is right here
you can see that this part is right here
you can see that this part is right here
which is the very front of the part
which is the very front of the part
which is the very front of the part
and just to show you the difference if
and just to show you the difference if
and just to show you the difference if
we were to put this
we were to put this
we were to put this
into objects or world space i should say
into objects or world space i should say
into objects or world space i should say
and we change it to cf
and we change it to cf
and we change it to cf
you can see that's all the way down here
you can see that's all the way down here
you can see that's all the way down here
it's not relative to this part
it's not relative to this part
it's not relative to this part
and so this allows you to get some
and so this allows you to get some
and so this allows you to get some
really cool behavior like let me change
really cool behavior like let me change
really cool behavior like let me change
it to new c frame
it to new c frame
it to new c frame
like for example no matter where i move
like for example no matter where i move
like for example no matter where i move
this part no matter how i rotate it
this part no matter how i rotate it
this part no matter how i rotate it
so let me just like rotate it like here
so let me just like rotate it like here
so let me just like rotate it like here
and here and whatever
and here and whatever
and here and whatever
the part will always
be facing the front of this part and
be facing the front of this part and
be facing the front of this part and
it'll like always be in this orientation
it'll like always be in this orientation
it'll like always be in this orientation
which is
which is
which is
really really cool so no matter where i
really really cool so no matter where i
really really cool so no matter where i
move it in the map
move it in the map
move it in the map
like if i move it this way move it up
like if i move it this way move it up
like if i move it this way move it up
it'll always be
it'll always be
it'll always be
at the front face of our part and this
at the front face of our part and this
at the front face of our part and this
is only one coordinate you can change
is only one coordinate you can change
is only one coordinate you can change
this c frame to whatever you and so
this c frame to whatever you and so
this c frame to whatever you and so
another useful thing with two world

is if we give it an angle so let's just
is if we give it an angle so let's just
is if we give it an angle so let's just
change our cf to c frame dot angles
change our cf to c frame dot angles
change our cf to c frame dot angles
0 math.rad whoops
0 math.rad whoops
0 math.rad whoops
90 and then 0. let me move this so
90 and then 0. let me move this so
90 and then 0. let me move this so
this is a c frame with the y
this is a c frame with the y
this is a c frame with the y
axis rotated by 90 degrees so since the
axis rotated by 90 degrees so since the

a radian evaluate to do math.radians to
a radian evaluate to do math.radians to
a radian evaluate to do math.radians to
convert our degree value to radian
convert our degree value to radian
convert our degree value to radian
values just ignore that if you don't
values just ignore that if you don't

but if we were to run this
but if we were to run this
but if we were to run this
this would rotate our part
this would rotate our part
this would rotate our part
by like 90 degrees you can't really see
by like 90 degrees you can't really see
by like 90 degrees you can't really see
that so a better example of this
that so a better example of this
that so a better example of this
if we set our part.c frame so let's just
if we set our part.c frame so let's just
if we set our part.c frame so let's just
say
say
say
part.c frame equals new c
part.c frame equals new c
part.c frame equals new c
frame so this will rotate our part by 90
frame so this will rotate our part by 90

and you can see it rotated by 90 degrees
and you can see it rotated by 90 degrees
and you can see it rotated by 90 degrees
the cool thing about this is since it's
