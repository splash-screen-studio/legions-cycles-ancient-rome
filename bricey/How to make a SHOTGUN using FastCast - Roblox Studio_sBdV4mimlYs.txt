then we can put negative workspace dot
then we can put negative workspace dot
then we can put negative workspace dot
gravity and then zero so this will make

test that out real quick make sure it's

the bullets are arcing

it's pretty cool and then
it's pretty cool and then

the next thing we want to do is

that is properly centered we have our

we add our the direction that we're
we add our the direction that we're
we add our the direction that we're
going times our displacement which is

like the length of the direction and
like the length of the direction and
like the length of the direction and
we have our last point so it's oriented
we have our last point so it's oriented
we have our last point so it's oriented

it doesn't matter but if in case you

so let's test that out real quick
yeah there we go let's see what we did

we can say if humanoid then will damage
