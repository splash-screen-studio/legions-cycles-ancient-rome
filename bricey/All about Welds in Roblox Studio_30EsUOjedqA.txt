will be this part and then part 1 will

will be this part and then part 1 will
be this part and
be this part and
be this part and
these parts are welded and the really
these parts are welded and the really
these parts are welded and the really
cool thing about this
cool thing about this
cool thing about this
is you can actually see the welds if you

is you can actually see the welds if you
go to model
go to model
go to model
show welds so i had it on by default and
show welds so i had it on by default and

then
then
then
if you want to see it on top of things
if you want to see it on top of things

you can
you can
you can
toggle draw on top i'm going to leave it

rotate it like so you can see they just
rotate it like so you can see they just
