model and roblox yeah I know I did so I
model and roblox yeah I know I did so I
model and roblox yeah I know I did so I
wrote a script that can do just that
so if I go in to my roblox game and I
so if I go in to my roblox game and I
so if I go in to my roblox game and I
start clicking around on the bread you
start clicking around on the bread you
start clicking around on the bread you
can see there's a bunch of little slices
can see there's a bunch of little slices
can see there's a bunch of little slices
of bread that we've created from our
of bread that we've created from our
of bread that we've created from our
loaf and we can do whatever we want with
loaf and we can do whatever we want with
loaf and we can do whatever we want with
these slices of bread and this is not
these slices of bread and this is not
these slices of bread and this is not
only for the bread so if I were to click
only for the bread so if I were to click
only for the bread so if I were to click
on my table my table has been sliced in
on my table my table has been sliced in
on my table my table has been sliced in
half and let's say I want to slice this
half and let's say I want to slice this
half and let's say I want to slice this
block in half I can slice it once I said
block in half I can slice it once I said
block in half I can slice it once I said
a few more times I can get these little
a few more times I can get these little
a few more times I can get these little
parts smaller and smaller and I can even
parts smaller and smaller and I can even

do this to a massive glass wall so let
do this to a massive glass wall so let
do this to a massive glass wall so let
me you know get part there slice a
me you know get part there slice a
me you know get part there slice a
little edge off there and here's our

split apart at wherever your mouse

clicks so I did this and this script
clicks so I did this and this script
clicks so I did this and this script
right here and this is that works let's
right here and this is that works let's
right here and this is that works let's
go in
and if I click wherever you can see one
and if I click wherever you can see one

color is where like one part and the
color is where like one part and the

other color is another part it's random
other color is another part it's random

so they could be the same color it just

mouse hit and I get a chunk and then I

just split it with this function right
just split it with this function right
just split it with this function right
here that only works for one side and

that's about it but I thought to myself

well roblox already has a built in a

union function with negating and

whatever so let me just demonstrate if I
whatever so let me just demonstrate if I
whatever so let me just demonstrate if I
make a part and I you know make it like
make a part and I you know make it like

this size and then I go to model and
this size and then I go to model and
this size and then I go to model and
then the gate and I can select those
then the gate and I can select those
then the gate and I can select those
three parts and Union them there is a

so can I apply the same concept to
so can I apply the same concept to
so can I apply the same concept to
slicing a part and this is my first
slicing a part and this is my first
slicing a part and this is my first
attempt at it let me run this
if I were to go up to this small part
if I were to go up to this small part
if I were to go up to this small part
over here and click it you can see a
over here and click it you can see a
over here and click it you can see a
slice it has gone through the park
slice it has gone through the park
slice it has gone through the park
problem is is this part is still only a
problem is is this part is still only a
problem is is this part is still only a
single union so that means each of the
single union so that means each of the
single union so that means each of the
sliced parts will go together so if I go
sliced parts will go together so if I go
sliced parts will go together so if I go
to the server real quick here we go and
to the server real quick here we go and
to the server real quick here we go and
if I were to throw this part around it
if I were to throw this part around it
if I were to throw this part around it
doesn't it stays together and I wasn't
doesn't it stays together and I wasn't

really satisfied with this but the

really satisfied with this but the
script was pretty simple all I basically
script was pretty simple all I basically
script was pretty simple all I basically
did was create a part where my mouse is
did was create a part where my mouse is
did was create a part where my mouse is
pointing and then I negate it so if I
pointing and then I negate it so if I
pointing and then I negate it so if I
were to you know wait a second just to
were to you know wait a second just to
were to you know wait a second just to
show you the whole process and I go up
show you the whole process and I go up
show you the whole process and I go up
to this part I can click it and you can
to this part I can click it and you can
to this part I can click it and you can
see the little slice spawns in and then
see the little slice spawns in and then
see the little slice spawns in and then
disappears where the part should be cut

this can work on any size part if you do

so then after a few long hours of

looks like it's pretty sure it took a

so I have a weight statement in there

just to show you sort of how it works

so where I click a part spawns to the
so where I click a part spawns to the
so where I click a part spawns to the
left and a part spawns to the right so
left and a part spawns to the right so
left and a part spawns to the right so
basically what happens is when I click
basically what happens is when I click
basically what happens is when I click
it spawns a part to the left and then it
it spawns a part to the left and then it
it spawns a part to the left and then it
creates a new Union from that part
creates a new Union from that part
creates a new Union from that part
negated from the piece of bread and then
negated from the piece of bread and then
negated from the piece of bread and then
it does the same thing for the opposite
it does the same thing for the opposite
it does the same thing for the opposite
side so this makes two separate unions

that are still like the same size put
