but
but
but
i'll get into that a little bit later
i'll get into that a little bit later
i'll get into that a little bit later
and i created my very own

mouse module and here it is
mouse module and here it is

so it's a pretty big module there are a
so it's a pretty big module there are a

the rest are just for convenience

but it's used to overwrite

what the default mouse is used for and i

so everyone can get it so if you want to

let's go to a demonstration i'll explain

the api a little bit later it'll just be

so i'm going to go into starter player

scripts and create a local

but it won't really do much since you

so i'm just going to get replicated

there we go so here we have our mouse

that just shows you how it works so i'm

and we're just going to do mouse module

we're going to print
we're going to print
we're going to print
actually we're going to make a variable
actually we're going to make a variable

local target
local target

equals mouse module dot get target

and then we're going to print our target

so
so
so
this function looks to see where the
this function looks to see where the
this function looks to see where the
mouse is pointing at

can see right now it's the base plate if

it's like my arm we have head
there's some other stuff yeah so this is

it tells you where it is and likewise we
