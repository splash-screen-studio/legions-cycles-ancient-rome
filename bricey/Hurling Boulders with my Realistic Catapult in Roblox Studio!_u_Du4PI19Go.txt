so right now i'm sitting
so right now i'm sitting
so right now i'm sitting
on my very own catapult
on my very own catapult
on my very own catapult
and so what this is is this is a model
and so what this is is this is a model
and so what this is is this is a model
that i built
that i built
that i built
in a roblox studio and you may be asking
in a roblox studio and you may be asking

you know anyone can make a catapult it's
you know anyone can make a catapult it's
you know anyone can make a catapult it's
pretty easy but the difference is
pretty easy but the difference is
pretty easy but the difference is
is that this catapult is completely

off of roblox physics so if i go into

off of roblox physics so if i go into
the constraints view
the constraints view
the constraints view
you can see this whole thing is run by
you can see this whole thing is run by
you can see this whole thing is run by
a couple hinge constraints a spring and
a couple hinge constraints a spring and
a couple hinge constraints a spring and
some visual effects
some visual effects
some visual effects
and on top of that i can drive it around
and on top of that i can drive it around
and on top of that i can drive it around
so let me go back in
so let me go back in
so let me go back in
and show you real quick don't mind that

so you can see i can drive this around i
so you can see i can drive this around i
so you can see i can drive this around i
can

can
load my ball
load my ball
load my ball
and i can throw it at the wall and i can
and i can throw it at the wall and i can
and i can throw it at the wall and i can
reload it
reload it
reload it
just drive it around
just drive it around
just drive it around
but you can see if i drive it around too
but you can see if i drive it around too
but you can see if i drive it around too
much the ball doesn't actually go into
much the ball doesn't actually go into
much the ball doesn't actually go into
the

the
arm you can just throw it wherever

and since it's a siege weapon i thought
and since it's a siege weapon i thought
and since it's a siege weapon i thought
to myself well let's make
to myself well let's make

some more so i was thinking about you
some more so i was thinking about you
some more so i was thinking about you
know a catapult or a trebuchet
know a catapult or a trebuchet
know a catapult or a trebuchet
and i just decided making catapult i'll
and i just decided making catapult i'll
and i just decided making catapult i'll
probably make a trebuchet in the future
probably make a trebuchet in the future
probably make a trebuchet in the future
and uh correct me if i'm pronouncing

i usually only see it written i never

i usually only see it written i never
really talk about it but
really talk about it but
really talk about it but
i went to this catapult and i was like
i went to this catapult and i was like
i went to this catapult and i was like
okay we're gonna like you know do the
okay we're gonna like you know do the
okay we're gonna like you know do the
same research whatever whatever and
same research whatever whatever and
same research whatever whatever and
when i was doing my research for the
when i was doing my research for the
when i was doing my research for the
catapult i realized that it's a lot
catapult i realized that it's a lot
catapult i realized that it's a lot
easier to make than a ballista so i
easier to make than a ballista so i
easier to make than a ballista so i
probably should have made this first but
probably should have made this first but
probably should have made this first but
let's go down on what it will look like
let's go down on what it will look like
let's go down on what it will look like
in game so let's start so a catapult
in game so let's start so a catapult
in game so let's start so a catapult
basically works you got a
basically works you got a
basically works you got a
pivot point and then you have your
pivot point and then you have your
pivot point and then you have your
little arm
right there and then you have your
right there and then you have your

you have a another little pull
you have a another little pull
you have a another little pull
and it's connected
and it's connected
and it's connected
to the arm via

to the arm via
a spring of some kind so usually it's
a spring of some kind so usually it's
a spring of some kind so usually it's
like a rubber band
like a rubber band

it's just all it is is to hold

and that works pretty well but when i
and that works pretty well but when i
and that works pretty well but when i
was testing this

was testing this
end game i realized that it would be
end game i realized that it would be
end game i realized that it would be
very hard
very hard
very hard
to simulate like a little spring

to simulate like a little spring
with like a rope instead because you
with like a rope instead because you
with like a rope instead because you
know in there like a real angie catapult

they did not have like these type
they did not have like these type
they did not have like these type
springs they had like you know the ropes

to like create tension and that's

to like create tension and that's
what gave the ball a rock i should say
what gave the ball a rock i should say
what gave the ball a rock i should say
boulder so much force so i looked up
boulder so much force so i looked up
boulder so much force so i looked up
some other designs
some other designs
some other designs
and i figured out that the ancient
and i figured out that the ancient
and i figured out that the ancient
romans actually used
romans actually used
romans actually used
a sort of scheme like
a sort of scheme like
a sort of scheme like
a ballista used on like the very bottom
a ballista used on like the very bottom
a ballista used on like the very bottom
to make tension so basically this is
to make tension so basically this is
to make tension so basically this is
like a top-down view
like a top-down view
like a top-down view
you would have let me get another color
you would have let me get another color
you would have let me get another color
you'd have like
you'd have like
you'd have like
this would be one side of the rope this
this would be one side of the rope this
this would be one side of the rope this
would be another side of the rope
would be another side of the rope
would be another side of the rope
and they would like twist over the
and they would like twist over the
and they would like twist over the
middle part and this would be
middle part and this would be
middle part and this would be
the arm from a top down view
the arm from a top down view
the arm from a top down view
and when the arm would rotate
and when the arm would rotate
and when the arm would rotate
so this would be from a side view you
so this would be from a side view you
so this would be from a side view you
get like kind of thick
get like kind of thick
get like kind of thick
kind of thick this would be the arm
kind of thick this would be the arm
kind of thick this would be the arm
whenever rotate
whenever rotate
whenever rotate
the ropes would like you know get a
the ropes would like you know get a
the ropes would like you know get a
little tension
little tension
little tension
and then when it reached the bottom you
and then when it reached the bottom you
and then when it reached the bottom you
release it and it'll get
release it and it'll get
release it and it'll get
launched you know far

so with this in mind i went to roblox
so with this in mind i went to roblox

catapult i got work to programming it
and it was quite simple because all i

and it was quite simple because all i
had to do was change the

and the spring up here would do all the

here's my script real quick let's
here's my script real quick let's
here's my script real quick let's
collapse it so it's a little bit easier

of these functions
they're all pretty self-explanatory
they're all pretty self-explanatory

projectile the boulder to explode when
it hit something
it hit something
it hit something
but it kind of doesn't work that well so
but it kind of doesn't work that well so
but it kind of doesn't work that well so
i just got rid of it it worked a lot
i just got rid of it it worked a lot
i just got rid of it it worked a lot
better with the ballista

so now it's here i press f it loads back
so now it's here i press f it loads back
so now it's here i press f it loads back
waits a few seconds creates the ball and
