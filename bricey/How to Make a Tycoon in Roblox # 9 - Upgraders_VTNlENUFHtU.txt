let's try it out
so you see the button is not here

initially so if we

get our cardboard dropper it appears
get our cardboard dropper it appears

we can get our upgrader

and you can see that
and you can see that
and you can see that
we're getting some decimals going on
we're getting some decimals going on
we're getting some decimals going on
and that's just because
the values are like 1.25 now
the values are like 1.25 now
the values are like 1.25 now
so it is changing
