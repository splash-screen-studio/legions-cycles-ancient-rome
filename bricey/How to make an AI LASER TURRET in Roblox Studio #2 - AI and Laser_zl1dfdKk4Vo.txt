so what we're doing here is we check if

how will this work let's go test it out

how will this work let's go test it out
let's go into the field so what I'm
let's go into the field so what I'm
let's go into the field so what I'm

down
down
down
and see which angle I want to like stop
and see which angle I want to like stop
and see which angle I want to like stop
so that's about as far as we can go this
so that's about as far as we can go this
so that's about as far as we can go this
is about as far as it could go because
is about as far as it could go because
is about as far as it could go because
this little base part is kind of big
this little base part is kind of big
this little base part is kind of big
so I'm going to go into my pitch and see
so I'm going to go into my pitch and see
so I'm going to go into my pitch and see
what angle
it says current angle is 32. now through
it says current angle is 32. now through

my own testing that's kind of not the
my own testing that's kind of not the

actually let's try it out let's see what
actually let's try it out let's see what
actually let's try it out let's see what

um let's set our depression to like
um let's set our depression to like
um let's set our depression to like
32.
32.
32.
so wait actually let's see let's see
so wait actually let's see let's see
so wait actually let's see let's see
where it goes let's actually place the
where it goes let's actually place the
where it goes let's actually place the
print so it starts down at 32 and if we
print so it starts down at 32 and if we
print so it starts down at 32 and if we
move it up where does it end up
it goes up booster
so down is 32. so if it's
so down is 32. so if it's
so down is 32. so if it's
well this is awesome
well this is awesome
well this is awesome
keep in mind this is also the turret
keep in mind this is also the turret
keep in mind this is also the turret
angle not necessarily
because what we're doing is we're

we actually set the target thing
so yeah see it doesn't detect us and

then once we get into the range
this is like 180 so let's see what angle
this is like 180 so let's see what angle
this is like 180 so let's see what angle
do we want
