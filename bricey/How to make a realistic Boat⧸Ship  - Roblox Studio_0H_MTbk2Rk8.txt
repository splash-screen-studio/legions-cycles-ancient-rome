but what we're basically doing here is

like you know how in real life boats
like you know how in real life boats
like you know how in real life boats
can't turn when they're stopped so we're
can't turn when they're stopped so we're
can't turn when they're stopped so we're
taking this idea and we're make we're
taking this idea and we're make we're
taking this idea and we're make we're
actually modeling a boat more
actually modeling a boat more
actually modeling a boat more
accurately by basically rotating the
accurately by basically rotating the
accurately by basically rotating the
vector of thrust so like whenever the
vector of thrust so like whenever the
vector of thrust so like whenever the
boat goes straight straight that's the
boat goes straight straight that's the
boat goes straight straight that's the
the only time it's like vector of thrust
the only time it's like vector of thrust
the only time it's like vector of thrust
can be rotated so we're basically like
can be rotated so we're basically like
can be rotated so we're basically like
turning the the motor like you know
turning the the motor like you know
turning the the motor like you know
motor boats how they have the motor on
motor boats how they have the motor on
motor boats how they have the motor on
the back and like it kind of goes side

math so usually the right Vector is
math so usually the right Vector is
math so usually the right Vector is
facing just straight like front and back
facing just straight like front and back
facing just straight like front and back
on the boats because um we use the X on
on the boats because um we use the X on
on the boats because um we use the X on
the vector Force to like go forward and
the vector Force to like go forward and
the vector Force to like go forward and
back usually Z is forward and back but
back usually Z is forward and back but
back usually Z is forward and back but
just because of attachments this is how
just because of attachments this is how
just because of attachments this is how
it's set up the primary axis X so and
it's set up the primary axis X so and
it's set up the primary axis X so and
then depending on the steer float we
then depending on the steer float we
then depending on the steer float we
rotate it by some amount and this is I'm
rotate it by some amount and this is I'm
rotate it by some amount and this is I'm
using math. pi because this is in
using math. pi because this is in
using math. pi because this is in
radians so it's not degrees it's just
radians so it's not degrees it's just
radians so it's not degrees it's just
easier to use this way but really all
easier to use this way but really all
easier to use this way but really all
you got to know is Raising this number
you got to know is Raising this number
you got to know is Raising this number
makes the like the turn amount tighter
makes the like the turn amount tighter
makes the like the turn amount tighter
lowering this number makes you able to
lowering this number makes you able to
lowering this number makes you able to
like turn more and quicker and yeah so
like turn more and quicker and yeah so
like turn more and quicker and yeah so
we also have to connect this function by
