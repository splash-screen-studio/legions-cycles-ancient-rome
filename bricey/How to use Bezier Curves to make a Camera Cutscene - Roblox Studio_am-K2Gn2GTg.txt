so now if we were to run it
you can see our curve is drawn
you can see our curve is drawn

bezier curves
bezier curves
bezier curves
out of the box is that the points are
out of the box is that the points are
out of the box is that the points are
not uniformly distributed so
not uniformly distributed so
not uniformly distributed so
let me change the step value here the t
let me change the step value here the t
let me change the step value here the t
value from 0.01 to just 0.1
value from 0.01 to just 0.1
value from 0.01 to just 0.1
and then we're going to draw a new curve
by making or actually we're gonna make
by making or actually we're gonna make

like
like
like
a little

or like an s
or like an s
or like an s
so we're gonna move this like over here
you might be able to see this
you might be able to see this
you might be able to see this
so you see how they're bunched more
so you see how they're bunched more
so you see how they're bunched more
closely down here
closely down here
closely down here
and how
like in the middle they're more spread
like in the middle they're more spread
like in the middle they're more spread
out and you can make this even more
out and you can make this even more
out and you can make this even more
extenuated if you want
extenuated if you want
extenuated if you want
to by like moving it around or whatever
to by like moving it around or whatever
to by like moving it around or whatever
so if i move this like even further
so if i move this like even further
so if i move this like even further
move this like back here
yeah
yeah
yeah
this is where you can see it so like it
this is where you can see it so like it
this is where you can see it so like it
curves up initially you see how close

that's why we're going to have to write
that's why we're going to have to write
that's why we're going to have to write
some extra code to do that for us
some extra code to do that for us
some extra code to do that for us
so the way we're going to do that is
so the way we're going to do that is
so the way we're going to do that is
using a lookup table
using a lookup table
using a lookup table
so a lookup table is basically just a
so a lookup table is basically just a
so a lookup table is basically just a
array of values
array of values

a value at a given point you go to that
a value at a given point you go to that
a value at a given point you go to that
table you find the two closest values

table you find the two closest values
and you just lerp in between them so you

you're going from zero to one so that'd
you're going from zero to one so that'd
you're going from zero to one so that'd
just be a hundred steps
just be a hundred steps
just be a hundred steps
so in each step we're going to calculate

the difference between the two vectors
the difference between the two vectors
the difference between the two vectors
which is like the

this is the next value of the lookup
this is the next value of the lookup
this is the next value of the lookup
table

and we're going to say
and we're going to say
and we're going to say
i divided by
i divided by
i divided by
l ut
l ut
l ut
and then comma i plus 1 divided by

lut so what the i and the let it looks
lut so what the i and the let it looks
lut so what the i and the let it looks
kind of confusing all it is is the
kind of confusing all it is is the
kind of confusing all it is is the
relative t value so we
relative t value so we
relative t value so we
have i which is
have i which is
have i which is
which is just like a normal integer and
which is just like a normal integer and
which is just like a normal integer and
we divide it by the number and the
we divide it by the number and the
we divide it by the number and the
lookup table so this turns this i from
lookup table so this turns this i from
lookup table so this turns this i from
an integer
an integer
an integer
into a percentage because as a it's the
into a percentage because as a it's the
into a percentage because as a it's the
percentage you are in the lookup table
percentage you are in the lookup table
percentage you are in the lookup table
and then i plus 1 is the equivalent of
and then i plus 1 is the equivalent of
and then i plus 1 is the equivalent of
like the next disk but instead of the
like the next disk but instead of the
like the next disk but instead of the
actual value we're just turning it into
actual value we're just turning it into
actual value we're just turning it into
another percentage so if lookup table is
another percentage so if lookup table is
another percentage so if lookup table is
10 values long and i is equal to 1 we
10 values long and i is equal to 1 we
10 values long and i is equal to 1 we
get 0.1 and then we get 0.2 so you're
get 0.1 and then we get 0.2 so you're
get 0.1 and then we get 0.2 so you're
mapping it from
mapping it from
mapping it from
the actual like distances concrete
the actual like distances concrete

and all we do
and all we do
and all we do
underneath this is we return the cubic
underneath this is we return the cubic

so all we're doing here is just
so all we're doing here is just

so all we did is change the underlying

oh one thing i forgot to do
oh one thing i forgot to do
oh one thing i forgot to do
is

is
change the actual new function to give
change the actual new function to give
change the actual new function to give
the number of segments so i'm going to

give it
give it
give it
10 segments for now since we're only

looping through it like 10 times to get
looping through it like 10 times to get
looping through it like 10 times to get
all those points
all those points

and then just make sure you have this
and then just make sure you have this
and then just make sure you have this
first number value in the busy.new

function
so you can see
so you can see

it loops a lot better

all the points are uniform even if we do
all the points are uniform even if we do
all the points are uniform even if we do
some funky
curve

all the points are still
all the points are still
all the points are still
uniform
so in the example i just showed you
so in the example i just showed you
so in the example i just showed you
some of the points weren't exactly truly
some of the points weren't exactly truly
some of the points weren't exactly truly
uniform that's because our number
uniform that's because our number
uniform that's because our number
segments was probably set a little too
segments was probably set a little too
segments was probably set a little too
low so that this value something like
low so that this value something like
low so that this value something like
100 if i run this again
100 if i run this again
100 if i run this again
you can see the segments are a lot more
you can see the segments are a lot more
you can see the segments are a lot more
evenly distributed which is exactly
