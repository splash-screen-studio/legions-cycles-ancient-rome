each time we move our mouse we want to
each time we move our mouse we want to
each time we move our mouse we want to
subtract that amount
subtract that amount
subtract that amount
from our main angle and we need to do
from our main angle and we need to do

the same thing with the camera angle y
the same thing with the camera angle y
the same thing with the camera angle y
but y is a little bit different because
but y is a little bit different because
but y is a little bit different because
we also need to clamp it so actually
we also need to clamp it so actually
we also need to clamp it so actually
let me do this again camera angle y

since we're dealing with the camera i'm

very very important reason we're doing
very very important reason we're doing
very very important reason we're doing
this is because

takes a radian value so we're basically
takes a radian value so we're basically
takes a radian value so we're basically
just taking our position and then we're
just taking our position and then we're
just taking our position and then we're
multiplying our camera angles
multiplying our camera angles
multiplying our camera angles
onto it and now we can
onto it and now we can

create our camera c frame
create our camera c frame
create our camera c frame
which will be equal to start c frame

point to world space
and so we want to make our camera c

y and then we want to set this to an

arbitrarily very large negative value so
arbitrarily very large negative value so
arbitrarily very large negative value so
i'm going to do negative like
i'm going to do negative like
i'm going to do negative like
million or that's a hundred thousand my

but set it to a big negative value
but set it to a big negative value
but set it to a big negative value
and this is just the focus so the focus
and this is just the focus so the focus
and this is just the focus so the focus
will be off in the distance so

will be off in the distance so
the camera will be over the shoulder it

the camera will be over the shoulder it
won't be pointing directly at our

third person camera applications so now

we can set our camera

we can set our camera
dot c frame equal to c frame dot
dot c frame equal to c frame dot
dot c frame equal to c frame dot
look at
camera c frame and then camera
camera c frame and then camera
camera c frame and then camera
focus
so basically this takes our two vector
so basically this takes our two vector
so basically this takes our two vector
threes i know this is kind of misleading
threes i know this is kind of misleading
threes i know this is kind of misleading
but
but
but
it sort of makes sense camera c frame is
it sort of makes sense camera c frame is
it sort of makes sense camera c frame is
actually a vector three value point two
actually a vector three value point two
actually a vector three value point two
world space returns a vector three
world space returns a vector three
world space returns a vector three
so we have our two vector threes camera
so we have our two vector threes camera
so we have our two vector threes camera
c frame which is like offset behind the
c frame which is like offset behind the

camera
camera
camera
the focus so it's at the c frame looking
the focus so it's at the c frame looking
the focus so it's at the c frame looking
at the focus
at the focus
at the focus
so if we were to run this
you can see our camera is
you can see our camera is
you can see our camera is
moving around quite nicely obviously our

is not following it so that's what we

next so now below our

camera c frame assignment we can say

local looking c frame equals c

two world space and then we want to set
two world space and then we want to set
two world space and then we want to set
a arbitrary vector three zero zero
a arbitrary vector three zero zero
a arbitrary vector three zero zero
and then another a very large negative
and then another a very large negative
and then another a very large negative
value
so this basically takes our root part
so this basically takes our root part
so this basically takes our root part
and makes it look
and makes it look
and makes it look
towards our sort of our camera c
towards our sort of our camera c
towards our sort of our camera c
frame focus basically but just to make
frame focus basically but just to make
frame focus basically but just to make
it easier we just use our camera
it easier we just use our camera
it easier we just use our camera
c frame and
c frame and

you might want to just set our root

you might want to just set our root

rotations
on all axes not just the y which is the
on all axes not just the y which is the
on all axes not just the y which is the
one we want to rotate
one we want to rotate
one we want to rotate
so now we need to do root part
so now we need to do root part
so now we need to do root part
dot c frame equals c frame dot from
dot c frame equals c frame dot from
dot c frame equals c frame dot from
matrix and we need to do root part
matrix and we need to do root part
matrix and we need to do root part
dot position then looking c
dot position then looking c
dot position then looking c
frame dot x vector then we need to do
frame dot x vector then we need to do
frame dot x vector then we need to do
root part dot c frame dot y
root part dot c frame dot y
root part dot c frame dot y
vector so this basically extracts the y
vector so this basically extracts the y
vector so this basically extracts the y
component like rotational component of

frame so we can keep everything else

about our player character but just
about our player character but just
about our player character but just
change its like y direction which is
change its like y direction which is
change its like y direction which is
exactly what we want
exactly what we want
exactly what we want
so if we were to play this
you can see our character rotates
you can see our character rotates
you can see our character rotates
with our mouse which is exactly what we
with our mouse which is exactly what we
with our mouse which is exactly what we
want
want

and sometimes i think that might not
and sometimes i think that might not
and sometimes i think that might not
work so one thing you want to add just
work so one thing you want to add just
work so one thing you want to add just
in case

is set our humanoid dot
is set our humanoid dot
is set our humanoid dot
auto rotate to false just
auto rotate to false just
auto rotate to false just
in case it doesn't work
in case it doesn't work
in case it doesn't work
mine works fine but humanoid rotate
mine works fine but humanoid rotate
mine works fine but humanoid rotate
false just makes it a little bit better
false just makes it a little bit better
false just makes it a little bit better
and just in case you're wondering the
and just in case you're wondering the
and just in case you're wondering the
reason we didn't just
reason we didn't just
reason we didn't just
set our camera angle x and camera angle
set our camera angle x and camera angle
set our camera angle x and camera angle

to our root part.c frame is because

when i did that and like the player ran
when i did that and like the player ran
when i did that and like the player ran
into a wall the wall kind of
into a wall the wall kind of

stopped their character from rotating
stopped their character from rotating
stopped their character from rotating
for like a few frames

so the body sort of became offset using

this method our camera stays the same
