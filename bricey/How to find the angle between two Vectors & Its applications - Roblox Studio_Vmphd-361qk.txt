so let's start with the little wiggling
issue because that's the easiest to
issue because that's the easiest to
issue because that's the easiest to
address that's because this direction
address that's because this direction
address that's because this direction
has a y component as well so as we move

it up the angle changes we don't want

so all we have to do to fix that is just

say like local flat Direction This is a

times vector3. new one zero one so what
times vector3. new one zero one so what

this does is we multiply each component
this does is we multiply each component
this does is we multiply each component
the X Y and Z of our vector
the X Y and Z of our vector
the X Y and Z of our vector
by one keeping it it doesn't change it
by one keeping it it doesn't change it

zero we get rid of the Y component and
zero we get rid of the Y component and
zero we get rid of the Y component and
then one we keep the Z component that
then one we keep the Z component that
then one we keep the Z component that
keeps it like on the flat plane so if we

it keeps all of this data but it gets

rid of the up down is we don't want that

you just want to set this axis to

which you're measuring your angle on our

measure angle is the X Z plane get the X

so the axis we want is just the y-axis

it's like the full Chromo which is

this is the y-axis of our of the world

rotation or our hinge so we're just

so let's try this again this should
