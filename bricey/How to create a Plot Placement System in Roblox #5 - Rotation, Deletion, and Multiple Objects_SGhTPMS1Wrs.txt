this a little bit more convoluted but

we have the preview index and we add the

so like let's say we have two objects
so like let's say we have two objects

and the index goes to three we want it

that CL so it's three so the the value

it's three minus or so shelf. prev index
it's three minus or so shelf. prev index
it's three minus or so shelf. prev index
would be two in this case so it' be 2

minus one which is 1 plus Direction
minus one which is 1 plus Direction
minus one which is 1 plus Direction
which would be two and then we do mod

objects number objects which is two so
objects number objects which is two so
objects number objects which is two so
this go back to zero plus 1 which would
this go back to zero plus 1 which would
this go back to zero plus 1 which would
be one so if we're at index if we're at

prev index two and our direction is one
prev index two and our direction is one
prev index two and our direction is one
so our our Target prev index is three

then it'll wrap back around to one and
