with our snappage or snapping to grid to
with our snappage or snapping to grid to
with our snappage or snapping to grid to
figure out how we can get a random

figure out how we can get a random
arbitrary point to conform to like a

blocky grid as you would see in a game
blocky grid as you would see in a game

like Minecraft so let's say we pick a
like Minecraft so let's say we pick a

point let's start with like one one
point let's start with like one one
point let's start with like one one
right here and this point you know it's
right here and this point you know it's
right here and this point you know it's
not really according to our grid because
not really according to our grid because
not really according to our grid because
we want our grid to be like a 3X3

okay so we have this point at 1 one but
okay so we have this point at 1 one but
okay so we have this point at 1 one but
we need to get it to somewhere like one
we need to get it to somewhere like one
we need to get it to somewhere like one
of these four points on the grid so for
of these four points on the grid so for
of these four points on the grid so for
our system I'm always going to choose
our system I'm always going to choose
our system I'm always going to choose
the bottom left point so this one one
the bottom left point so this one one
the bottom left point so this one one
needs to move down to 0 0 it has to get
needs to move down to 0 0 it has to get
needs to move down to 0 0 it has to get
there that that's the goal we want it to
there that that's the goal we want it to
there that that's the goal we want it to
move to this bottom point so how do we
move to this bottom point so how do we
move to this bottom point so how do we
do that so I guess let's actually bring
do that so I guess let's actually bring
do that so I guess let's actually bring
out the number so it makes a little bit
out the number so it makes a little bit
out the number so it makes a little bit
more sense so this would be one one we
more sense so this would be one one we
more sense so this would be one one we
need to get it to 0 0 so what we'll do
need to get it to 0 0 so what we'll do
need to get it to 0 0 so what we'll do
is we'll divide this number by the grid
is we'll divide this number by the grid
is we'll divide this number by the grid
size so the grid size is three so we'll
size so the grid size is three so we'll
size so the grid size is three so we'll
divide it by three but you'll notice we
divide it by three but you'll notice we
divide it by three but you'll notice we
get like 1/3 for each coordinate 13 and
get like 1/3 for each coordinate 13 and
get like 1/3 for each coordinate 13 and
this is a fraction which can also be
this is a fraction which can also be
this is a fraction which can also be
represented in decimal by some you know
represented in decimal by some you know
represented in decimal by some you know
zero with a bunch of other stuff after

well 3 three repeated I think yeah right
well 3 three repeated I think yeah right
well 3 three repeated I think yeah right
something like that I know my math um
something like that I know my math um
something like that I know my math um
but this is not z0 it's close though so
but this is not z0 it's close though so
but this is not z0 it's close though so
how can we get it 0 Z there's a function
how can we get it 0 Z there's a function
how can we get it 0 Z there's a function
called floor which allows us to do that
called floor which allows us to do that
called floor which allows us to do that
and by floor what floor does like like
and by floor what floor does like like
and by floor what floor does like like
math. floor it just cuts out the decimal

portion we don't care about it anymore
portion we don't care about it anymore
portion we don't care about it anymore
and it and it moves it down to the
and it and it moves it down to the
and it and it moves it down to the
lowest value so this this um 0.33 just
lowest value so this this um 0.33 just
lowest value so this this um 0.33 just
becomes zero and so we get 0 0 now that
becomes zero and so we get 0 0 now that
becomes zero and so we get 0 0 now that

guess to find a new Point Let's do

negative one one right here so this
negative one one right here so this
negative one one right here so this
would

would
be -1 one and when we divide this by
be -1 one and when we divide this by
be -1 one and when we divide this by
three again we'll get some like we'll
three again we'll get some like we'll
three again we'll get some like we'll
get 0.33 repeated for the X and then
get 0.33 repeated for the X and then
get 0.33 repeated for the X and then
0.33 for the Y and we already dealt with
0.33 for the Y and we already dealt with
0.33 for the Y and we already dealt with
the Positive so we don't really care
the Positive so we don't really care
the Positive so we don't really care
we're more interested in this negative
we're more interested in this negative
we're more interested in this negative
portion right here this is a 3 three

because now now we have zero and now we

numbers that aren't zero is you have to
numbers that aren't zero is you have to

this in this case it'll be three so
this in this case it'll be three so
this in this case it'll be three so
it'll take our point from here all the
it'll take our point from here all the
it'll take our point from here all the

y the second one and then for the third
y the second one and then for the third
y the second one and then for the third
parameter say pos. Z / grid size so this

multiply it by grid size this will
multiply it by grid size this will
multiply it by grid size this will
always move our position to a valid grid
always move our position to a valid grid
always move our position to a valid grid
position and then we'll multiply it by

it's moving along like the primary axes
it's moving along like the primary axes
of the C frame so let's do that so what

trying to get this
right yeah that's about right okay so
right yeah that's about right okay so

that's our normal vector and so that's

that's our normal vector and so that's
like protruding from the wall facing
like protruding from the wall facing
like protruding from the wall facing
away from the wall and in here we want
away from the wall and in here we want

to move all of these positions relative
to move all of these positions relative
to move all of these positions relative
to this normal vector and we can do that
to this normal vector and we can do that
to this normal vector and we can do that
in the code and then all we have to
in the code and then all we have to
in the code and then all we have to
do is get is get the vector from our

Point get it like right here and then we
Point get it like right here and then we

have to get the components of that so
have to get the components of that so
have to get the components of that so
we'll get the x or relative X component
we'll get the x or relative X component
we'll get the x or relative X component
and the relative y component and then
and the relative y component and then
and the relative y component and then
this will kind of point us in the right
this will kind of point us in the right
this will kind of point us in the right
