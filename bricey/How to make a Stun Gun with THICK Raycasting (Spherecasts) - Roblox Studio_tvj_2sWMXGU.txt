don't care at scripts and we're going to

we're gonna play this John
and we're gonna stun the crap out of the

zombie why is he so
zombie why is he so
zombie why is he so
but

he does in fact get sun you see him like

then boom you stun him he's in the floor
then boom you stun him he's in the floor
then boom you stun him he's in the floor
he can't move that's what we want but
he can't move that's what we want but
he can't move that's what we want but
it's weird for the player because you
it's weird for the player because you
it's weird for the player because you
can't really see what you're stunning so
can't really see what you're stunning so
can't really see what you're stunning so
let's add some a little visualization to
let's add some a little visualization to
let's add some a little visualization to
this so first off let's create our beam
this so first off let's create our beam
this so first off let's create our beam
and I'm going to create it in the
and I'm going to create it in the
and I'm going to create it in the
workspace just for now the beam is going
workspace just for now the beam is going
workspace just for now the beam is going
to be a cylinder and this cylinder if I
to be a cylinder and this cylinder if I
to be a cylinder and this cylinder if I
go
we're gonna make the cylinder
we're gonna make the cylinder
we're gonna make the cylinder
can't Collide off anchored true because
can't Collide off anchored true because
can't Collide off anchored true because
we're gonna like spawn on the world I'm
we're gonna like spawn on the world I'm
we're gonna like spawn on the world I'm
going to create the build like a force
going to create the build like a force
going to create the build like a force
field just

look
the same color as what I did before and
the same color as what I did before and
the same color as what I did before and
then don't you don't really know what
then don't you don't really know what
then don't you don't really know what
you're worried about the size
you're worried about the size
you're worried about the size
but one thing I want to mention is we're
but one thing I want to mention is we're
but one thing I want to mention is we're
going to be using
going to be using
going to be using
um a pivot here so
um a pivot here so
um a pivot here so
because we're dealing with a cylinder we
because we're dealing with a cylinder we
because we're dealing with a cylinder we
kind of want like cylinders are weird
kind of want like cylinders are weird
kind of want like cylinders are weird
because their front face if I show
because their front face if I show
because their front face if I show
her front face is like out to the side
her front face is like out to the side
her front face is like out to the side
of the cylinder which is kind of stupid
of the cylinder which is kind of stupid
of the cylinder which is kind of stupid
so the best way to like move the
so the best way to like move the
so the best way to like move the
cylinder and position in the world is to
cylinder and position in the world is to
cylinder and position in the world is to
use the pivot so if I go to edit pivot
use the pivot so if I go to edit pivot
use the pivot so if I go to edit pivot
see our pivots here what we want is
see our pivots here what we want is
see our pivots here what we want is
every time we spawn in a new beam we
every time we spawn in a new beam we
every time we spawn in a new beam we
want the pivot to be at the very back so
want the pivot to be at the very back so
want the pivot to be at the very back so
like back here
like back here
like back here
where where the uh where the base of the
where where the uh where the base of the
where where the uh where the base of the
beam is and then we also want to make
beam is and then we also want to make
beam is and then we also want to make
sure the front face feeds the pivot's
sure the front face feeds the pivot's
sure the front face feeds the pivot's
front face is still here so we're going
front face is still here so we're going
front face is still here so we're going
to take the pivot and we're just going
to take the pivot and we're just going
to take the pivot and we're just going
to rotate it
that was not it you need to edit a bit
that was not it you need to edit a bit
that was not it you need to edit a bit
of the pivot and then rotate it
of the pivot and then rotate it
of the pivot and then rotate it
so from my testing it's front face here
so from my testing it's front face here
so from my testing it's front face here
and you set it to like negative 90 on
and you set it to like negative 90 on
and you set it to like negative 90 on
the
the
the
y orientation for the pivot it should
y orientation for the pivot it should
y orientation for the pivot it should
work out the position doesn't actually
work out the position doesn't actually
work out the position doesn't actually
matter actually while we're here set the
matter actually while we're here set the
matter actually while we're here set the
position back to zero because you're
position back to zero because you're
position back to zero because you're
going to be offsetting it in the code
going to be offsetting it in the code
going to be offsetting it in the code
but the orientation is important it
but the orientation is important it
but the orientation is important it
doesn't work just play around with the Y
doesn't work just play around with the Y
doesn't work just play around with the Y
orientation to get the beam spawning
orientation to get the beam spawning
orientation to get the beam spawning
properly but I want a cylinder because
properly but I want a cylinder because
properly but I want a cylinder because
it looks good we're going to use a
it looks good we're going to use a
it looks good we're going to use a
cylinder
cylinder
cylinder
but this is our beam done so I'm going
but this is our beam done so I'm going
but this is our beam done so I'm going
to rename it to beam shove it into
to rename it to beam shove it into
to rename it to beam shove it into
server storage because we need to like
server storage because we need to like
server storage because we need to like
Source it to spawn it in now we're going
Source it to spawn it in now we're going
Source it to spawn it in now we're going
to get that beam but that's how we're
to get that beam but that's how we're
to get that beam but that's how we're
going to say local beam equals
going to say local beam equals
going to say local beam equals
workspace or I guess game get service

dot there we go so we got our beam let's
dot there we go so we got our beam let's
dot there we go so we got our beam let's
go clone our beam actually let's rename
go clone our beam actually let's rename
go clone our beam actually let's rename
this at the top to the beam template
this at the top to the beam template
this at the top to the beam template
so we can create a beam and say local
so we can create a beam and say local
so we can create a beam and say local
beam equals beam template there's a
beam equals beam template there's a
beam equals beam template there's a
couple things we have to do to visualize
couple things we have to do to visualize
couple things we have to do to visualize
this beam first off we need to set the
this beam first off we need to set the
this beam first off we need to set the
size so beam dot size will be equal to
size so beam dot size will be equal to
size so beam dot size will be equal to
vector3 dot new
vector3 dot new
vector3 dot new
so the x of a cylinder is the length of
so the x of a cylinder is the length of
so the x of a cylinder is the length of
the beam so we need to set this beam
the beam so we need to set this beam
the beam so we need to set this beam
length equal to the length of the Ray
length equal to the length of the Ray
length equal to the length of the Ray
and we're going to Define a variable
and we're going to Define a variable
and we're going to Define a variable
above called distance and this will be
above called distance and this will be
above called distance and this will be
equal to the length of the ray it'll be
equal to the length of the ray it'll be
equal to the length of the ray it'll be
the position minus the beam origin of
the position minus the beam origin of
the position minus the beam origin of
position

so this is basically
so this is basically
so this is basically
where the ray starts to where it goes
where the ray starts to where it goes
where the ray starts to where it goes
that little vector magnitude so the
that little vector magnitude so the
that little vector magnitude so the
length so we're going to do distance as
length so we're going to do distance as
length so we're going to do distance as
the x value and then for the Y the Z
the x value and then for the Y the Z
the x value and then for the Y the Z
we're just going to set it to the radius
we're just going to set it to the radius
we're just going to set it to the radius
of the sun radius because
of the sun radius because
of the sun radius because
we're gonna make it as thick as it will
we're gonna make it as thick as it will
we're gonna make it as thick as it will
be as the sphere cast will be
be as the sphere cast will be
be as the sphere cast will be
and then we need to set the beam.pivot
and then we need to set the beam.pivot
and then we need to set the beam.pivot
offset equal to the beam.pivot offset
offset equal to the beam.pivot offset
offset equal to the beam.pivot offset
because the beam pivot offset is a C
because the beam pivot offset is a C
because the beam pivot offset is a C
frame we do not want to edit the
frame we do not want to edit the
frame we do not want to edit the
orientation so we're going to offset the
orientation so we're going to offset the
orientation so we're going to offset the
pivot offset by a vector three so all
pivot offset by a vector three so all
pivot offset by a vector three so all
we're doing is changing the
we're doing is changing the
we're doing is changing the
position of the pivot offset that's why
position of the pivot offset that's why
position of the pivot offset that's why
if your position is set to something
if your position is set to something
if your position is set to something
it'll just change it we don't want that
it'll just change it we don't want that
it'll just change it we don't want that
so make sure your position is set to
so make sure your position is set to
so make sure your position is set to
zero zero zero so we're going to do
zero zero zero so we're going to do
zero zero zero so we're going to do
pivot offset minus
pivot offset minus
pivot offset minus
vector3 dot x-axis so we're going to
vector3 dot x-axis so we're going to

offset it on the x-axis I
offset it on the x-axis I
offset it on the x-axis I

negative two so we want those on the B
negative two so we want those on the B
negative two so we want those on the B
here so we'll take our x coordinate and
here so we'll take our x coordinate and
here so we'll take our x coordinate and
we'll just kind of divide it by two and
we'll just kind of divide it by two and
we'll just kind of divide it by two and
we subtract it so that's why it's
we subtract it so that's why it's
