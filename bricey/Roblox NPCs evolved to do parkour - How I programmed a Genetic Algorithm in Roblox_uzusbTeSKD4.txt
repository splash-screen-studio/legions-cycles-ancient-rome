one of the rays that we just saw so
one of the rays that we just saw so
one of the rays that we just saw so
let me get a ray
let me get a ray
let me get a ray
so each one of these arrays like this is

it would have a

go back to our other
go back to our other
go back to our other

just be 0.7
just be 0.7
just be 0.7
in this case it would be a negative

so since we have a bunch of rays each of

these rays has reserved two values in
these rays has reserved two values in

our little array now we could have made
our little array now we could have made

this an array of arrays with each ray
this an array of arrays with each ray
this an array of arrays with each ray
having its own array and rays that's

getting kind of complicated but each

so from here we can take all these
so from here we can take all these
so from here we can take all these
values

and like we take all of them from here
and like we take all of them from here
and like we take all of them from here
on out too

and then we can just sum them all up we
and then we can just sum them all up we
and then we can just sum them all up we
can sum up all the move ones so this
can sum up all the move ones so this
can sum up all the move ones so this
will be like a move sum
and then we can sum up all the jump ones
and then we can sum up all the jump ones
and then we can sum up all the jump ones
and we get a jump sum
and this of course is taking all of the
and this of course is taking all of the
and this of course is taking all of the
values

from the rest of them as well and
from the rest of them as well and
from the rest of them as well and
putting them all together and what we do
putting them all together and what we do
putting them all together and what we do
with these is we check if the move sum
with these is we check if the move sum
with these is we check if the move sum
is greater than zero or if the jump and
is greater than zero or if the jump and
is greater than zero or if the jump and
f4 the jump sum is greater than zero we
f4 the jump sum is greater than zero we
f4 the jump sum is greater than zero we
we move and or jump so these are
we move and or jump so these are
we move and or jump so these are
independent of each other if the move
independent of each other if the move
independent of each other if the move
sum is greater than zero we move if the
sum is greater than zero we move if the

jump sum is greater than zero we jump
jump sum is greater than zero we jump
jump sum is greater than zero we jump
and that's really all we need for this
and that's really all we need for this
and that's really all we need for this
situation because the
situation because the
situation because the
npc's can only move basically
npc's can only move basically
npc's can only move basically
in like one and a half dimensions they
in like one and a half dimensions they
in like one and a half dimensions they
can move forward and then it can jump
can move forward and then it can jump
can move forward and then it can jump
which is kind of like binary like on or
which is kind of like binary like on or
which is kind of like binary like on or
off and same with the move

and the most important part of this
and the most important part of this
and the most important part of this
system is that the genes are randomized
system is that the genes are randomized

they're randomized to begin with and

they're randomized as the simulation
they're randomized as the simulation
they're randomized as the simulation
goes on this way we get variation
goes on this way we get variation
goes on this way we get variation
and the variation leads to different

weights that allow the npc to jump at

different times depending on what
different times depending on what
different times depending on what
happens but then what exactly do we do
happens but then what exactly do we do
happens but then what exactly do we do
with the npcs in the end so we give them
with the npcs in the end so we give them
with the npcs in the end so we give them
a fitness score of course we give them a
a fitness score of course we give them a
a fitness score of course we give them a

the way this works
the way this works
the way this works
is here you can see we have a bunch of

somewhere like over here probably this
somewhere like over here probably this
somewhere like over here probably this
is where they want to get to
is where they want to get to
is where they want to get to
we give them a score based on their
we give them a score based on their
we give them a score based on their
distance from the goal position so we're
distance from the goal position so we're
distance from the goal position so we're
basically like have an imaginary ruler
basically like have an imaginary ruler
basically like have an imaginary ruler
from zero to however far it's possible
from zero to however far it's possible
from zero to however far it's possible
to be away
to be away
to be away
from the goal and we score them so for

example an npc here
example an npc here
example an npc here
would have a higher score than one over
would have a higher score than one over
would have a higher score than one over
here
here
here
so lower scores are better in our case
so lower scores are better in our case
so lower scores are better in our case
here
here
here
and then that allows us to sort
and then that allows us to sort
and then that allows us to sort
who did good and who did bad
who did good and who did bad
who did good and who did bad
which allows us to continue on the

so
so
so
once we have found their scores we can
once we have found their scores we can

now sort
now sort
now sort
the scores
the scores
the scores
and then what we're going to do with
and then what we're going to do with
and then what we're going to do with
them is split them in half we take the
them is split them in half we take the
them is split them in half we take the
best scores
and we get rid of the bad scores because
and we get rid of the bad scores because
and we get rid of the bad scores because
these scores are bad enough where
these scores are bad enough where
these scores are bad enough where
there's no point to keep them so we keep
there's no point to keep them so we keep
there's no point to keep them so we keep
these parents within the gene pool but
these parents within the gene pool but

then we also
then we also
then we also
perform some crossover to get children
perform some crossover to get children
perform some crossover to get children
from these parents that may or may not
from these parents that may or may not

be a little better than the parents so
be a little better than the parents so
be a little better than the parents so
we pair up the parents
we pair up the parents
we pair up the parents
and these fitness scores have their

genes like you know encapsulated within

like two children
like two children
like two children
and same with these two they would mate

and then make two children so how
and then make two children so how
and then make two children so how
exactly does that process work

so we get on here we have two separate

genes that was kind of random we pick a
genes that was kind of random we pick a
genes that was kind of random we pick a

then we cut it in half so for example
then we cut it in half so for example
then we cut it in half so for example
here this this is called the crossover
here this this is called the crossover
here this this is called the crossover
point because this whole point of the

genetic algorithm process is called the
genetic algorithm process is called the
genetic algorithm process is called the
crossover step because we're going to
crossover step because we're going to
crossover step because we're going to
cross over this part of the gene here
cross over this part of the gene here
cross over this part of the gene here
with this part of the gene here
so we take this part and move it down to
