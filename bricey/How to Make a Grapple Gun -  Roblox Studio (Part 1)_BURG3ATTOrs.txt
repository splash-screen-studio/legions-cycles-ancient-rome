so now i'm going to go create a new part
so now i'm going to go create a new part
so now i'm going to go create a new part
and this will be our actual handle for

and this will be our actual handle for
our gun so let me just move this to
our gun so let me just move this to
our gun so let me just move this to
where

where
the player should be holding it and
the player should be holding it and
the player should be holding it and
we're going to resize it a little bit
we're going to resize it a little bit
we're going to resize it a little bit
make it smaller and actually we're just

and just put that as our handle so there
and just put that as our handle so there

we go and then we're just going to move
we go and then we're just going to move
we go and then we're just going to move
it back a little bit so it's aligned
it back a little bit so it's aligned
it back a little bit so it's aligned
properly and for testing purposes we're

going to make it semi-transparent like a
going to make it semi-transparent like a
going to make it semi-transparent like a
0.5 transparency

and then we're going to name this part
and then we're going to name this part
and then we're going to name this part
handle there we go

our little grappling hook will be

run service there we go and we're just
run service there we go and we're just
run service there we go and we're just
going to set up a little test
going to set up a little test
going to set up a little test
i'm going to say if
i'm going to say if
i'm going to say if
run service is client

is server then and we're going to print
is server then and we're going to print

running from the client
running from the client
running from the client
and then we're just going to copy this
and then we're just going to copy this
and then we're just going to copy this
running from the server there we go so
running from the server there we go so
running from the server there we go so
if you run this
if you run this
if you run this
you can see that it says running from
you can see that it says running from
you can see that it says running from
the server on the server and then
the server on the server and then
the server on the server and then
running from the client
running from the client
running from the client
on the client so it does exactly what we
on the client so it does exactly what we
on the client so it does exactly what we
want it to do
want it to do
want it to do
which is really nice and we can make
which is really nice and we can make
which is really nice and we can make
this a little bit better
this a little bit better

but let me just delete these lines
but let me just delete these lines
but let me just delete these lines
we can make this a function we're going
we can make this a function we're going
we can make this a function we're going
to find local
to find local
to find local
function init and this is this is the
function init and this is this is the

initializer function for when our module
initializer function for when our module
initializer function for when our module
gets required
gets required
gets required
it'll set everything up and get
it'll set everything up and get
it'll set everything up and get
everything to work
everything to work
everything to work
so we have our init function and then
so we have our init function and then
so we have our init function and then
make sure this is a very very very
make sure this is a very very very
make sure this is a very very very
important step
important step
important step
that you write and knit at the very
that you write and knit at the very
that you write and knit at the very
bottom of your script
bottom of your script
bottom of your script
and this will cause this function to run
and this will cause this function to run
and this will cause this function to run
once our module is required if you don't
once our module is required if you don't
once our module is required if you don't
have this nothing will happen
have this nothing will happen
have this nothing will happen
ever when you're making your grapple gun
ever when you're making your grapple gun
ever when you're making your grapple gun
and you won't be able to do absolutely
and you won't be able to do absolutely
and you won't be able to do absolutely
anything
anything
anything
and so right above this in that function
and so right above this in that function
and so right above this in that function
we're going to define two functions
we're going to define two functions
we're going to define two functions
local function
server init and then above that we're
server init and then above that we're
server init and then above that we're
gonna do a local
gonna do a local
gonna do a local
function client in it
function client in it
function client in it
there you go so you know where this is
there you go so you know where this is
there you go so you know where this is
going

going
when we initialize we want to check if
when we initialize we want to check if
when we initialize we want to check if
it's the client if it is a client we
it's the client if it is a client we
it's the client if it is a client we
run a client init and then if is is a
run a client init and then if is is a
run a client init and then if is is a
server we run a server in it
server we run a server in it
server we run a server in it
so it just like depends on which one is
so it just like depends on which one is
so it just like depends on which one is
running which and using this run service
running which and using this run service
running which and using this run service
it's really really
it's really really
it's really really
cool that you can do this and now we
cool that you can do this and now we
cool that you can do this and now we
just need to fill
just need to fill
just need to fill
each of these function blocks with
each of these function blocks with
each of these function blocks with
functionality
functionality
functionality
so let's add some basic functionality to
so let's add some basic functionality to
so let's add some basic functionality to
our initialized functions
our initialized functions
our initialized functions
but before we do that we have to define
but before we do that we have to define
but before we do that we have to define
a bunch of variables
a bunch of variables
a bunch of variables
at the very top of our script so firstly
at the very top of our script so firstly
at the very top of our script so firstly
we're going to do local tool
we're going to do local tool
we're going to do local tool
equal script dot parent
equal script dot parent
equal script dot parent
and then we're going to do local
let's do local if i can spell local
let's do local if i can spell local
let's do local if i can spell local
correctly local

base equals tool wait
base equals tool wait
base equals tool wait

i'm gonna do local hook equals tool
i'm gonna do local hook equals tool
i'm gonna do local hook equals tool
wait for child hook
wait for child hook
wait for child hook
and do local hook reference
and do local hook reference
and do local hook reference
equals tool wait for child
equals tool wait for child
equals tool wait for child
hook ref reference there we go
hook ref reference there we go
hook ref reference there we go
and let's go get our hook weld
and let's go get our hook weld
and let's go get our hook weld
and just make sure let's see our hook
and just make sure let's see our hook
and just make sure let's see our hook
weld is in our hook
weld is in our hook
weld is in our hook
so local hook world equals hook
so local hook world equals hook
so local hook world equals hook
dot hook weld

dot hook weld
and then local
and then local
and then local
let's move this up here local spring
let's move this up here local spring
let's move this up here local spring
equals base dot spring
equals base dot spring
equals base dot spring
base dot spring there we go so let's run
base dot spring there we go so let's run
base dot spring there we go so let's run
this make sure everything is working
this make sure everything is working
this make sure everything is working
properly let's just
properly let's just
properly let's just
run around so there's no like wait for
run around so there's no like wait for

child error so that's good
child error so that's good
child error so that's good
let's go back into our module
let's go back into our module
let's go back into our module
and now let's define a few more

so these are going to be the variables
so these are going to be the variables
so these are going to be the variables
that are only been only going to be

it's going to be local player

the server really won't be able to use
