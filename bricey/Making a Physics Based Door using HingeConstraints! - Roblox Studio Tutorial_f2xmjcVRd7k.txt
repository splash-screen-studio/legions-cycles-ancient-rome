in my case they're pointing upwards and

this means

around the axis in which they are both

so it's what you saw before
so it's what you saw before

and there's also the secondary axises

and these determine the angle

for your hinge and the reason this is

on our hinge we have to enable

this little green thing is the limits of

your hinge so right now if i were to

play this
you can see that the hinge can only go
you can see that the hinge can only go
you can see that the hinge can only go
45 degrees

45 degrees
in either direction and that's because

if i go back to this little area you can

here you have the main axis of your

and the way this angle is calculated is

the angle between

your attachment zero secondary axis and

these arrows at the side are literally

right now personally this doesn't look

very intuitive

and it doesn't make much sense so i'm
and it doesn't make much sense so i'm

going to take my secondary axises and
going to take my secondary axises and
going to take my secondary axises and
rotate them
rotate them
rotate them
to face towards our door part i'm going

to take both of them and do that
to take both of them and do that
to take both of them and do that
and the reason i'm doing both of them is

because this sets like when the
because this sets like when the
because this sets like when the
secondary the secondary axises are at

that is angle zero of your hinge so
that is angle zero of your hinge so
that is angle zero of your hinge so
right now it's at angle zero
right now it's at angle zero
right now it's at angle zero
and i wanna set my limits i'm gonna set

the

want the door to open
we can set it to angle 90 target angle

i'm going to set it back
i'm going to set it back
i'm going to set it back
to zero and then i'm going to

take my door and my pivot and just group
take my door and my pivot and just group
take my door and my pivot and just group
them

because that'll make it easier for me to

work with with my script and we're going
work with with my script and we're going
work with with my script and we're going
to name this

door and i'm going to create a script
door and i'm going to create a script
door and i'm going to create a script
in my door i'm going to go back we'll
in my door i'm going to go back we'll
in my door i'm going to go back we'll
deal with that script in just a second
deal with that script in just a second
deal with that script in just a second
and i'm going to go create a click
and i'm going to go create a click
and i'm going to go create a click
detector

inside of my door part so when you click
inside of my door part so when you click
inside of my door part so when you click
on the door it will open
on the door it will open
on the door it will open
now i'm going to go into my script
now i'm going to go into my script
now i'm going to go into my script
define local
define local

door model equal script dot parent
door model equal script dot parent

i'm going to find local pivot which will
i'm going to find local pivot which will
i'm going to find local pivot which will
be equal to

door model dot pivot
door model dot pivot
door model dot pivot
and then now we can just go define our
and then now we can just go define our
and then now we can just go define our
click detector so local click
click detector so local click
click detector so local click
detector equals door dot click
so in order to understand if our door is
so in order to understand if our door is
so in order to understand if our door is
open or closed we need to give our
open or closed we need to give our
open or closed we need to give our
script another variable
script another variable
script another variable
local open and we're going to set this
local open and we're going to set this
local open and we're going to set this
to false because right now
to false because right now
to false because right now
the door is not open so open equals
the door is not open so open equals
the door is not open so open equals
false this will be a boolean either true
false this will be a boolean either true
false this will be a boolean either true
or false
or false
or false
and then whenever you click on the door
and then whenever you click on the door
and then whenever you click on the door
so let's
so let's
so let's
say local click detector not local click
say local click detector not local click
say local click detector not local click
detector we're just going to
detector we're just going to
detector we're just going to
use click detector that we defined above
use click detector that we defined above
use click detector that we defined above
we're going to say click detector dot
we're going to say click detector dot
we're going to say click detector dot
mouse click
mouse click
mouse click
and so whenever the player clicks the
and so whenever the player clicks the
and so whenever the player clicks the
mouse this will fire we're going to
mouse this will fire we're going to
mouse this will fire we're going to
connect
connect
connect
a function and then enter give us some

a function and then enter give us some
space we're going to set open equal to

not
not
not
open so if open is false it'll make it
open so if open is false it'll make it
open so if open is false it'll make it
true if open is true it'll make it false
true if open is true it'll make it false
true if open is true it'll make it false
it just

it just
negates it inverts it whatever you want
negates it inverts it whatever you want

and now we're going to find our target
and now we're going to find our target
and now we're going to find our target
angle and this target angle will be
angle and this target angle will be
angle and this target angle will be
equal to
equal to
equal to
open and
open and
open and
90 or 0. so what this means is it says
90 or 0. so what this means is it says
90 or 0. so what this means is it says
if open is true then
if open is true then
if open is true then
set the target angle to 90 we haven't
set the target angle to 90 we haven't
set the target angle to 90 we haven't
set it yet but this is just a variable
set it yet but this is just a variable
set it yet but this is just a variable
and if open is false we set the target
and if open is false we set the target
and if open is false we set the target
angle to zero you don't really have to
angle to zero you don't really have to
angle to zero you don't really have to
understand this is some

understand this is some
logic shorthand it can make your script
