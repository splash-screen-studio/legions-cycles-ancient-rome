so let's go to our anchor for example
so let's go to our anchor for example
so let's go to our anchor for example
so the anchor is a new part
so the anchor is a new part
so the anchor is a new part
in my game that allows parts around it

in my game that allows parts around it
to be anchored because that seemed like

so when i click this you can see

anchor's highlighted so that means

let's go to
let's go to
let's go to
the anchor component and it has a

that's anchor and this tag is what nit
that's anchor and this tag is what nit
that's anchor and this tag is what nit
uses to

figure out where it should go so

when the game starts nit checks oh
when the game starts nit checks oh
when the game starts nit checks oh
is this part is this part an anchor or
is this part is this part an anchor or
is this part is this part an anchor or
is it tagged with anchor or checks all
is it tagged with anchor or checks all
is it tagged with anchor or checks all
parts that have the tag of anchor
parts that have the tag of anchor
parts that have the tag of anchor
and it gives it this
