three five there we go
three five there we go
three five there we go
and each element of this array has an
and each element of this array has an
and each element of this array has an
index so the index starts with one
index so the index starts with one
index so the index starts with one
so you have one actually there's one
so you have one actually there's one
so you have one actually there's one
there's two and there's three
there's two and there's three
there's two and there's three
important to note unlike other languages

zero so just keep that in mind
but this is your normal array and it

is just let me just get rid of this real
is just let me just get rid of this real

is just to create a normal array
is just to create a normal array
is just to create a normal array
and let me enter in and you create an
and let me enter in and you create an
and let me enter in and you create an
array
array
array
inside of an array so this is called a
inside of an array so this is called a
inside of an array so this is called a
nested array

and i can put like a zero zero zero as
and i can put like a zero zero zero as
and i can put like a zero zero zero as
all my elements
all my elements
all my elements
and then i can just copy this paste it
and then i can just copy this paste it
and then i can just copy this paste it
paste it there you go so this is the
paste it there you go so this is the
paste it there you go so this is the
most basic way to create a
most basic way to create a
most basic way to create a
multi-dimensional array
multi-dimensional array
multi-dimensional array
and then i can change like let's say i
and then i can change like let's say i
and then i can change like let's say i
change the middle one
change the middle one
change the middle one
and the way you'd access this is let me
and the way you'd access this is let me
and the way you'd access this is let me
just make a print statement
just make a print statement
just make a print statement
print array i want to go to
print array i want to go to
print array i want to go to
the second index like the second table
the second index like the second table
the second index like the second table
and then i want to go to the second
and then i want to go to the second
and then i want to go to the second
element of that second table
element of that second table
element of that second table
so basically what this does is this code
so basically what this does is this code
so basically what this does is this code
right here is we access the first
right here is we access the first
right here is we access the first
or the second i should say element of
or the second i should say element of
or the second i should say element of
our array and since our array is made up
our array and since our array is made up
our array and since our array is made up
of other arrays it accesses
of other arrays it accesses
of other arrays it accesses
this second array since this is one
this second array since this is one
this second array since this is one
this is two and this is three
this is two and this is three
this is two and this is three
and since we want to access this
and since we want to access this
and since we want to access this
one we need to go to the second element
one we need to go to the second element
one we need to go to the second element
of our second array and that gives us
of our second array and that gives us
of our second array and that gives us
this one
this one
this one
so if we run this you can see it prints
so if we run this you can see it prints
so if we run this you can see it prints
one because that's exactly
one because that's exactly
one because that's exactly
where our one is and that's good
where our one is and that's good
where our one is and that's good
for a basic array
for a basic array
for a basic array
so this works fine for now but let's say
so this works fine for now but let's say
so this works fine for now but let's say
you want to have an array
you want to have an array
you want to have an array
that's 25 by 25 or 50 by 50. and i
that's 25 by 25 or 50 by 50. and i
that's 25 by 25 or 50 by 50. and i
actually used something like this
actually used something like this
actually used something like this
when i created my maze using prim's

algorithm if you haven't seen that make
algorithm if you haven't seen that make
algorithm if you haven't seen that make
sure you check it out
sure you check it out
sure you check it out
but and the way i did that was just
but and the way i did that was just
but and the way i did that was just
using
using
using
a function and i'll define it right here
a function and i'll define it right here
a function and i'll define it right here
that just automatically creates
that just automatically creates
that just automatically creates
your multi-dimensional array so let's
your multi-dimensional array so let's
your multi-dimensional array so let's
define a local
define a local
define a local
function create array
function create array
function create array
and we'll take in the number of rows the
and we'll take in the number of rows the
and we'll take in the number of rows the
number of columns
number of columns
number of columns
and then the default value and this
and then the default value and this
and then the default value and this
default value that
default value that
default value that
is actually pretty important but you'll
is actually pretty important but you'll
is actually pretty important but you'll
find out why in just a second
find out why in just a second
find out why in just a second
so now we're going to make a loop our
so now we're going to make a loop our
so now we're going to make a loop our
first we're going to make
first we're going to make
first we're going to make
our array so local r equals
our array so local r equals
our array so local r equals
these two brackets and we're just going
these two brackets and we're just going
these two brackets and we're just going
to leave it blank for now because we'll
to leave it blank for now because we'll
to leave it blank for now because we'll
fill it a little bit later
fill it a little bit later
fill it a little bit later
and we're going to return our array and
and we're going to return our array and
and we're going to return our array and
then we're going to do a for loop
then we're going to do a for loop
then we're going to do a for loop
for x equals one rows do
for x equals one rows do
for x equals one rows do
and then for y equals one calls
and then for y equals one calls
and then for y equals one calls
due and so this will run
due and so this will run
due and so this will run
for every row and for every column that
for every row and for every column that
for every row and for every column that
you want to make
you want to make
you want to make
so each time you want to make a new row
so each time you want to make a new row
so each time you want to make a new row
just like our array that we defined up
just like our array that we defined up
just like our array that we defined up
here
here
here
let me just redefine an array so you can
let me just redefine an array so you can
let me just redefine an array so you can
use this
use this
use this
as your example
as your example
as your example
there we go
just make it work there we go so this is
just make it work there we go so this is
just make it work there we go so this is
our array so
our array so
our array so
we want a loop and for each row we want
we want a loop and for each row we want
we want a loop and for each row we want
to create a new array and then for each
to create a new array and then for each
to create a new array and then for each
column we want to populate this array
column we want to populate this array
column we want to populate this array
with a bunch of values so let's do that
with a bunch of values so let's do that
with a bunch of values so let's do that
so we want to go
so we want to go
so we want to go
r and then put the x value in
r and then put the x value in
r and then put the x value in
for the like the loop and we want to set
for the like the loop and we want to set
for the like the loop and we want to set
this equal to a
this equal to a
this equal to a
blank array and we want to set r x
blank array and we want to set r x
blank array and we want to set r x
y to
y to
y to
our default value
our default value
our default value
and then that that'll be it so this just
and then that that'll be it so this just
and then that that'll be it so this just
loops there
loops there
loops there
creates a new array for each row and
creates a new array for each row and
creates a new array for each row and
then populates that array with our
then populates that array with our
then populates that array with our
default value element
default value element
default value element
and if this default value is nil it will
and if this default value is nil it will
and if this default value is nil it will
not

not
create the array properly i don't know
create the array properly i don't know
create the array properly i don't know
why

there's probably a good reason but i
there's probably a good reason but i
there's probably a good reason but i
just don't know off the top my head
just don't know off the top my head
just don't know off the top my head
so just make sure to put a default value
so just make sure to put a default value
so just make sure to put a default value
but if you don't
but if you don't
but if you don't
you can just add some code like this or
you can just add some code like this or
you can just add some code like this or
zero so it'll put 0 by default but
zero so it'll put 0 by default but
zero so it'll put 0 by default but
right now let's just leave it like this
right now let's just leave it like this
right now let's just leave it like this
it's more simple so then we can define
it's more simple so then we can define
it's more simple so then we can define
our new array and this will be
our new array and this will be
our new array and this will be
the create array and let's do a 5x5
the create array and let's do a 5x5
the create array and let's do a 5x5
array
array
array
with the default value of zero and we
with the default value of zero and we
with the default value of zero and we
can print
can print
can print
our new array let's just say five
our new array let's just say five
our new array let's just say five
five there we go so if we run this
five there we go so if we run this
five there we go so if we run this
it prints zero because obviously we set
it prints zero because obviously we set
it prints zero because obviously we set
it to zero
it to zero
it to zero
and then we can change like a value so
and then we can change like a value so
and then we can change like a value so
new array
new array
new array
five five can be set to three
five five can be set to three
five five can be set to three
or two and it prints two
or two and it prints two
or two and it prints two
and that's pretty good
and that's pretty good
and that's pretty good
and so since we are in lua you can set
and so since we are in lua you can set
and so since we are in lua you can set
whoops you can set your default value to
whoops you can set your default value to
whoops you can set your default value to
absolutely anything like a c

you so let me just get it out real quick
you so let me just get it out real quick
you so let me just get it out real quick
it's called the array2d module
it's called the array2d module
it's called the array2d module
and i will show you how to use it
and i will show you how to use it

to our ray2d so local ray2d
equals require
game.replicatorstorage.array2d

array2d as array2d.new
array2d as array2d.new
array2d as array2d.new
and it takes in rows and columns let's
and it takes in rows and columns let's
and it takes in rows and columns let's
do like a 3x3 array
do like a 3x3 array
do like a 3x3 array
and the d you could put a default value
and the d you could put a default value
and the d you could put a default value
but it automatically defaults to zero so
but it automatically defaults to zero so
but it automatically defaults to zero so
we'll just leave it like that
we'll just leave it like that
we'll just leave it like that
and we can print our new array and
and we can print our new array and

usually with like a normal table it just
