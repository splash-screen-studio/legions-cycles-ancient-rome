local function recurse and it's going to
local function recurse and it's going to

say if I equals 5 we're going to
say if I equals 5 we're going to
say if I equals 5 we're going to
just
just
just
return and so if I equals 5 then we're
return and so if I equals 5 then we're
return and so if I equals 5 then we're
just going to return so in that case we
just going to return so in that case we
just going to return so in that case we
won't actually reach the next recurse so
won't actually reach the next recurse so
won't actually reach the next recurse so
it'll call recurse and then we'll go
it'll call recurse and then we'll go
it'll call recurse and then we'll go
through go through and then we will stop
through go through and then we will stop
through go through and then we will stop
once I equal 5 because we won't be able
once I equal 5 because we won't be able

just run on its own like this is a
just run on its own like this is a
just run on its own like this is a

nearly the same Loop thing well
nearly the same Loop thing well
nearly the same Loop thing well
obviously we have the old stuff that we
obviously we have the old stuff that we

that's just because I um you know botch
that's just because I um you know botch
that's just because I um you know botch
the condition with the for Loop it goes

from zero until I is less than or equal
from zero until I is less than or equal
from zero until I is less than or equal
to 5 so this really should be if I is

greater than five we return so we get to
greater than five we return so we get to
greater than five we return so we get to
less than or equal to five but whatever
less than or equal to five but whatever
less than or equal to five but whatever
you know it's good enough so this is the

factorial so factorial is basically
factorial so factorial is basically
factorial so factorial is basically
where you have a
where you have a
where you have a
number let's say five and so the
number let's say five and so the
number let's say five and so the
factorial five which is like five
factorial five which is like five
factorial five which is like five
exclamation mark would be five *
exclamation mark would be five *
exclamation mark would be five *
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 and that would give you
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 and that would give you
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 and that would give you
the factorial which should be 120 and
the factorial which should be 120 and
the factorial which should be 120 and
that's what it is that's a factorial of
that's what it is that's a factorial of
that's what it is that's a factorial of
five and if you look at it the the
five and if you look at it the the
five and if you look at it the the
factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 this
factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 this
factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 this
is almost the same as saying is 5

loop or for Loop you can speak but it's
loop or for Loop you can speak but it's

function factorial we're just going to
function factorial we're just going to
function factorial we're just going to
say fact we're going to take a number n
say fact we're going to take a number n
say fact we're going to take a number n
um and this is going to have you know
um and this is going to have you know
um and this is going to have you know
two cases so first we need the base case
two cases so first we need the base case
two cases so first we need the base case
what is this function going to like stop
what is this function going to like stop
what is this function going to like stop
on that's the case of zero factorial
on that's the case of zero factorial
on that's the case of zero factorial
because in math zero factorial is just
because in math zero factorial is just
because in math zero factorial is just
defined as one so if n equal 0 then
defined as one so if n equal 0 then
defined as one so if n equal 0 then
we're going to return one this function
we're going to return one this function
we're going to return one this function
is actually just going to be a recursive
is actually just going to be a recursive
is actually just going to be a recursive
function that returns like recursive
function that returns like recursive
function that returns like recursive
values so then what we need to do is
values so then what we need to do is
values so then what we need to do is
implement the next part which is like
implement the next part which is like
implement the next part which is like
returning like the actual recursive step
returning like the actual recursive step
returning like the actual recursive step
so the base case is this part up here
so the base case is this part up here
so the base case is this part up here
now we need to do the recursive step
now we need to do the recursive step
now we need to do the recursive step
which is down here where we're going to
which is down here where we're going to
which is down here where we're going to
turn n times factorial of
turn n times factorial of
turn n times factorial of
nus1 so what this is going to do is like
nus1 so what this is going to do is like
nus1 so what this is going to do is like
just like our example here 5 factorial
just like our example here 5 factorial
just like our example here 5 factorial
we plug in and five okay it's not zero
we plug in and five okay it's not zero
we plug in and five okay it's not zero
we we ski that it's going to be 5 * 4
we we ski that it's going to be 5 * 4
we we ski that it's going to be 5 * 4
and it's going to go back up and it's
and it's going to go back up and it's
and it's going to go back up and it's
not that it's not any equals z so it's
not that it's not any equals z so it's
not that it's not any equals z so it's
going to be 4 * 3 and this goes 5 * 5 *
going to be 4 * 3 and this goes 5 * 5 *
going to be 4 * 3 and this goes 5 * 5 *
4 then 5 * 4 * 3 then 5 * 4 * 2 * 2 and
4 then 5 * 4 * 3 then 5 * 4 * 2 * 2 and
4 then 5 * 4 * 3 then 5 * 4 * 2 * 2 and
until you get zero which is going to
until you get zero which is going to
until you get zero which is going to
give you one and then that propagates
give you one and then that propagates
give you one and then that propagates
all the way back up so you're
all the way back up so you're
all the way back up so you're
multiplying your current iteration
multiplying your current iteration
multiplying your current iteration
number times the next iteration of the
number times the next iteration of the
number times the next iteration of the
recursive step so if we print factorial
recursive step so if we print factorial
recursive step so if we print factorial
of five we should I did my stuff
of five we should I did my stuff
of five we should I did my stuff
correctly get 120 indeed we do we get
correctly get 120 indeed we do we get
correctly get 120 indeed we do we get
120 so that is a simple factorial
120 so that is a simple factorial
120 so that is a simple factorial
function for you a good example of
