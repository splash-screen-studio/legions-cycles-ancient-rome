these are super cool cool constraints
these are super cool cool constraints
these are super cool cool constraints
that can be used for a lot of
that can be used for a lot of
that can be used for a lot of
applications in your roblox games and
applications in your roblox games and
applications in your roblox games and
i really enjoy playing around with them
i really enjoy playing around with them
i really enjoy playing around with them
and in this video i'll show you like all
and in this video i'll show you like all
and in this video i'll show you like all
the properties and i'll show you a
the properties and i'll show you a
the properties and i'll show you a
little demonstration of what you can do
little demonstration of what you can do
little demonstration of what you can do
with them

like so
and without further ado let's get into

so let's begin with spring constraints
so let's begin with spring constraints
so let's begin with spring constraints
so spring constraints are exactly what
so spring constraints are exactly what
so spring constraints are exactly what
they sound like
they sound like
they sound like
they're basically just springs so here i
they're basically just springs so here i
they're basically just springs so here i
have a part
have a part
have a part
and then we can duplicate this part we
and then we can duplicate this part we
and then we can duplicate this part we
have another part and then let's go to
have another part and then let's go to
have another part and then let's go to
model create and then create a spring
model create and then create a spring
model create and then create a spring
so springs have two attachments and they
so springs have two attachments and they
so springs have two attachments and they
basically just specify where you want
basically just specify where you want
basically just specify where you want
the spring to start and end
the spring to start and end
the spring to start and end
so i'm going to put a attachment there
so i'm going to put a attachment there
so i'm going to put a attachment there
and attachment there and here you have
and attachment there and here you have
and attachment there and here you have
your spring
your spring
your spring
so let's just run this without changing
so let's just run this without changing
so let's just run this without changing
any of the properties
any of the properties
any of the properties
you can see nothing really happens
you can see nothing really happens
you can see nothing really happens
there's like a specified length and this
there's like a specified length and this
there's like a specified length and this
length
length
length
does not change when you start it and
does not change when you start it and
does not change when you start it and
this property
this property
this property
is called the free length and so this is
is called the free length and so this is
is called the free length and so this is
the
the
the
length that you want the spring to
length that you want the spring to
length that you want the spring to
maintain if you bring them any closer or
maintain if you bring them any closer or
maintain if you bring them any closer or
they'll try to push out if you bring
they'll try to push out if you bring
they'll try to push out if you bring
them any farther they'll try to pull in
them any farther they'll try to pull in
them any farther they'll try to pull in
just like a spring would do and so up
just like a spring would do and so up
just like a spring would do and so up
here in the properties let's just go
here in the properties let's just go
here in the properties let's just go
over the coils
over the coils
over the coils
all of this stuff is all visuals i don't
all of this stuff is all visuals i don't
all of this stuff is all visuals i don't
really need to go over it
really need to go over it
really need to go over it
and then down here you have yourself all
and then down here you have yourself all
and then down here you have yourself all
the spring stuff so the damping
the spring stuff so the damping
the spring stuff so the damping
is how delayed or like slow
is how delayed or like slow
is how delayed or like slow
down the effects are so let me just
down the effects are so let me just
down the effects are so let me just
anchor this one part let me actually
anchor this one part let me actually
anchor this one part let me actually
bring it up real quick
bring it up real quick
bring it up real quick
let me anchor it just so you can see a
let me anchor it just so you can see a
let me anchor it just so you can see a
little bit better
little bit better
little bit better
you can see it kind of springs a little
you can see it kind of springs a little
you can see it kind of springs a little
bit
bit
bit
and depending on how much the damping is
and depending on how much the damping is
and depending on how much the damping is
it goes a little bit slower so let's
it goes a little bit slower so let's
it goes a little bit slower so let's
change damping to like 100
hit play you can see it's a lot
hit play you can see it's a lot
hit play you can see it's a lot
slower it's not as reactive or quick
and then let's go to limits limits are
and then let's go to limits limits are
and then let's go to limits limits are
pretty self-explanatory
pretty self-explanatory
pretty self-explanatory
they define a max and min
they define a max and min
they define a max and min
limit for your spring and this is
limit for your spring and this is
limit for your spring and this is
regardless of the damping or any other
regardless of the damping or any other
regardless of the damping or any other
physics things like it literally will

not go past a certain amount
not go past a certain amount
not go past a certain amount
so we play this you can see it
so we play this you can see it
so we play this you can see it
automatically snaps into place

let me go out and then turn on
let me go out and then turn on

so if i go into game and i try moving
so if i go into game and i try moving
so if i go into game and i try moving
this i can't even move it
this i can't even move it
this i can't even move it
like farther than a certain amount
like farther than a certain amount
like farther than a certain amount
because of limits

because of limits
we can also demo this inside of studio
we can also demo this inside of studio
we can also demo this inside of studio
you can see i
you can see i
you can see i
cannot move it anywhere past this

cannot move it anywhere past this
at all i can drag it for some reason
at all i can drag it for some reason

that's kind of stupid
that's kind of stupid
that's kind of stupid
but when i use the move tool i can't do
but when i use the move tool i can't do
but when i use the move tool i can't do

so let's go back to our spring and then
so let's go back to our spring and then
so let's go back to our spring and then
we have our max force which is pretty
we have our max force which is pretty
we have our max force which is pretty
self-explanatory the max amount of force
self-explanatory the max amount of force
self-explanatory the max amount of force
the coil of the spring can apply to your
the coil of the spring can apply to your
the coil of the spring can apply to your
two parts
two parts
two parts
and the stiffness which is basically the
and the stiffness which is basically the
and the stiffness which is basically the
opposite of damping

it's how much force not how much force
it's how much force not how much force
it's how much force not how much force
it's basically how much force needs to
it's basically how much force needs to
it's basically how much force needs to
be applied to the spring to bring it
be applied to the spring to bring it
be applied to the spring to bring it
back
back
back
to its free length and that's regardless
to its free length and that's regardless
to its free length and that's regardless
of the limit so if we play this
of the limit so if we play this
of the limit so if we play this
and we can shove that around and it can
and we can shove that around and it can
and we can shove that around and it can
like move around
like move around

and more stiffness means more power so
and more stiffness means more power so

let me change my increment to 0.25 there
let me change my increment to 0.25 there
let me change my increment to 0.25 there
we go
we go
we go
so we can line them up properly
let's put that there let's put this down
let's put that there let's put this down
let's put that there let's put this down
and then we can make another part
and then we can make another part
and then we can make another part
right here let's say
anchor it and then create a
spring and this is a demonstration it
spring and this is a demonstration it
spring and this is a demonstration it
doesn't really do much

doesn't really do much
but like let me actually move this
but like let me actually move this
but like let me actually move this
but it's a good demonstration there we
but it's a good demonstration there we
