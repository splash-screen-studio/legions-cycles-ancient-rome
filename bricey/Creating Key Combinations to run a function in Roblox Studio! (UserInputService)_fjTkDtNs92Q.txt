script requires it when
script requires it when
script requires it when
a certain input requirement is met so
a certain input requirement is met so
a certain input requirement is met so
this could be multiple inputs
this could be multiple inputs
this could be multiple inputs
and that's basically what it's meant for
and that's basically what it's meant for
and that's basically what it's meant for
so on a windows device i could do

control c
and control v you have to hold ctrl and

then press those letters
then press those letters
then press those letters
in order for the action to occur and you
in order for the action to occur and you

can also do

versatile so i'm going to define my

first variable this is going to be

local user input service and this is the
local user input service and this is the
local user input service and this is the

that gets the input and this service is
that gets the input and this service is

really convenient i spelled that wrong

let's do user input service there we go
let's do user input service there we go
let's do user input service there we go
because it allows you to detect player
because it allows you to detect player
because it allows you to detect player
input and also check

if a button is being pressed down and
if a button is being pressed down and

that's exactly what we want
that's exactly what we want
that's exactly what we want
so i'm going to rename my module

be storing

be storing
all of our event connections for
all of our event connections for
all of our event connections for
our input module so just like the
our input module so just like the

contacts action service
contacts action service
contacts action service
which can bind and unbind certain
which can bind and unbind certain
which can bind and unbind certain
actions this service will be able to do
actions this service will be able to do
actions this service will be able to do
the exact same
the exact same

i say service it's a module script but
i say service it's a module script but
i say service it's a module script but
it could be the equivalent of a service

so our first function that we're going

and we'll need a few parameters first
and we'll need a few parameters first

one's the name this will be
one's the name this will be

useful for binding and unbinding then

this is a function that will fire once
this is a function that will fire once
this is a function that will fire once
all the keybinds have been pressed
all the keybinds have been pressed
all the keybinds have been pressed
and then we're going to do three dots
and then we're going to do three dots
and then we're going to do three dots
or ellipses so this parameter basically
or ellipses so this parameter basically
or ellipses so this parameter basically
means
means
means
there's a variable amount of parameters
there's a variable amount of parameters
there's a variable amount of parameters
that will come after this
ellipses so it's basically just a tuple
ellipses so it's basically just a tuple
ellipses so it's basically just a tuple
which is just like
which is just like
which is just like
a bunch of variables and in order to
a bunch of variables and in order to
a bunch of variables and in order to
actually use it we'll have to
actually use it we'll have to
actually use it we'll have to
pack it so local
pack it so local

keys will be equal to table dot pack

dot dot dot so it basically takes these

whatever amount of variables is after

this because this will be for our key
this because this will be for our key
this because this will be for our key
codes so

we can have two kikos like ctrl c or we
we can have two kikos like ctrl c or we
we can have two kikos like ctrl c or we
can have three key codes like control
can have three key codes like control
can have three key codes like control
then shift then c so it just doesn't
then shift then c so it just doesn't
then shift then c so it just doesn't
matter but we need to store it here

and interesting thing is is there's also

a variable

in this table called n so keys dot n and
in this table called n so keys dot n and

we're just going to set this to nil
we're just going to set this to nil
we're just going to set this to nil
because we're not going to need it
because we're not going to need it
because we're not going to need it
it just gives you the amount of

so now we're going to set binds
bracket's name so we're referencing a

but for right now we need a key code

code and this is just to be safe we're
code and this is just to be safe we're
code and this is just to be safe we're
going to check
going to check
going to check
if input dot key code and
if input dot key code and

and then we're going to check if input
and then we're going to check if input
and then we're going to check if input
dot key code is equal
dot key code is equal
dot key code is equal
to keys number

check
if there's a key code first of all and

so we have to do the same idea here and
so we have to do the same idea here and
so we have to do the same idea here and
now what we're going to do
now what we're going to do
now what we're going to do
is we're going to run through for i keys
is we're going to run through for i keys
is we're going to run through for i keys
and pairs keys
and pairs keys
and pairs keys
actually it'd be for i key and pair keys
actually it'd be for i key and pair keys
actually it'd be for i key and pair keys
my bad we're going to check if
my bad we're going to check if
my bad we're going to check if
not user input service

then return so what this will do
then return so what this will do
then return so what this will do
is it'll say is the key down

if the key is not down we're going to
if the key is not down we're going to
if the key is not down we're going to
return the function so the

action will not execute and the reason
action will not execute and the reason

we're doing this in such a weird fashion
we're doing this in such a weird fashion
we're doing this in such a weird fashion
is because no matter how many keys we
is because no matter how many keys we
is because no matter how many keys we
are if we like if only one key is right
are if we like if only one key is right
are if we like if only one key is right
that's still not good enough we have to
that's still not good enough we have to
that's still not good enough we have to
make sure all of them are right so the
make sure all of them are right so the
make sure all of them are right so the
way i'm doing it here
way i'm doing it here
way i'm doing it here
is if one of them is wrong it's going to
is if one of them is wrong it's going to
is if one of them is wrong it's going to
stop it completely so if none of them is
stop it completely so if none of them is
stop it completely so if none of them is
wrong it's just going to skip

this for loop and so after we verify
this for loop and so after we verify
this for loop and so after we verify
that all the keys
that all the keys
that all the keys
are pressed we're going to call the

it'll be equal to just print

this will be our key code so i'm going

enum.keycode.c so when i press ctrl c
enum.keycode.c so when i press ctrl c
enum.keycode.c so when i press ctrl c
this should say keys were pressed
this should say keys were pressed
this should say keys were pressed
so let's test that out
so if i press ctrl c you can see keys
so if i press ctrl c you can see keys
so if i press ctrl c you can see keys
were pressed but if i only press c
were pressed but if i only press c
were pressed but if i only press c
nothing happens if i only press control
nothing happens if i only press control
nothing happens if i only press control
nothing happens
nothing happens

so you have to hold both of them and
so you have to hold both of them and
so you have to hold both of them and
also notice you can hold ctrl and then
also notice you can hold ctrl and then
also notice you can hold ctrl and then
press c
press c
press c
but you can't hold c and then press ctrl
but you can't hold c and then press ctrl

it works very very well now there's only

unbind key presses
unbind key presses

disconnect so this is a

is just like a touched event
is just like a touched event
is just like a touched event
or any other event in roblox and we're
or any other event in roblox and we're

storing it
storing it
storing it
in a key in our binds table so when we

want to disconnect
want to disconnect
want to disconnect
our event we just go to the same table
our event we just go to the same table

there we go lowercase input and we're
there we go lowercase input and we're
there we go lowercase input and we're
gonna wait five seconds let's say
gonna wait five seconds let's say

so you can see i keep on pressing and
