the function
the function
the function
self on worth change
and it should be bank so bank on worth
and it should be bank so bank on worth
and it should be bank so bank on worth
change so when our worth
change so when our worth
change so when our worth
is changed we will get the worth that'll

plus equals worth so we'll just add
plus equals worth so we'll just add
plus equals worth so we'll just add
the worth to our balance and then what
the worth to our balance and then what
the worth to our balance and then what
we also want to do is change that little
we also want to do is change that little
we also want to do is change that little
gui that display gui to the actual

balance that we have currently so we
balance that we have currently so we
balance that we have currently so we
won't update it and i'm going to make a
won't update it and i'm going to make a
won't update it and i'm going to make a
dedicated function for that because
dedicated function for that because
dedicated function for that because
we're going to be using it quite a bit
we're going to be using it quite a bit
we're going to be using it quite a bit
so i'm going to do function
so i'm going to do function
so i'm going to do function
bank set display and this will take in
bank set display and this will take in
bank set display and this will take in
the string that we want to set our
the string that we want to set our
the string that we want to set our
display to

and then do a dot dot self dot balance
and then do a dot dot self dot balance
and then do a dot dot self dot balance
so it'll take the dollar sign
so it'll take the dollar sign
so it'll take the dollar sign
concatenate it to our current
concatenate it to our current
concatenate it to our current
balance which is exactly what we want
balance which is exactly what we want
balance which is exactly what we want
so we can try that out right now
and then if we get our then you can see
and then if we get our then you can see
and then if we get our then you can see
our
our
our

so we need to add that so we need to
so we need to add that so we need to
so we need to add that so we need to
hook another event to our bank in it and
hook another event to our bank in it and
hook another event to our bank in it and
this will be self.instance
this will be self.instance
this will be self.instance

so
so
so
below our set display we can just make a

and then
and then
and then
we want to get the players so i'm going
we want to get the players so i'm going
we want to get the players so i'm going
to say local player equals game

so then we can say if player
so then we can say if player
so then we can say if player
and player equals self.tycoon.owner

then so if the player exists and the

then we can do something and i just want
then we can do something and i just want
