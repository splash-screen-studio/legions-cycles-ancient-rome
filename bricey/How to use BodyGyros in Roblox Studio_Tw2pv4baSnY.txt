so a body gyro and roblox studio is a
type of body mover that allows
type of body mover that allows
type of body mover that allows
a part that it's parented to
a part that it's parented to
a part that it's parented to
to point or orient in a specific

and it will maintain that orientation
and it will maintain that orientation
and it will maintain that orientation
depending on how much power you get it
depending on how much power you get it
depending on how much power you get it
so in order to make a body gyro we first
so in order to make a body gyro we first
so in order to make a body gyro we first
need a part
need a part
need a part
here's our part we're going to leave
here's our part we're going to leave
here's our part we're going to leave
that part there
that part there
that part there
and we're going to the part type in body
and we're going to the part type in body
and we're going to the part type in body
gyro and a little plus
gyro and a little plus
gyro and a little plus
we see we have our body gyro and
we see we have our body gyro and
we see we have our body gyro and
out of the box it does nothing
out of the box it does nothing
out of the box it does nothing
and it's gonna be a really messy to try
and it's gonna be a really messy to try
and it's gonna be a really messy to try
to work with our body gyro while it
to work with our body gyro while it
to work with our body gyro while it
keeps on falling
keeps on falling
keeps on falling
because it doesn't affect the position
because it doesn't affect the position
because it doesn't affect the position
it only affects the orientation
it only affects the orientation
it only affects the orientation
so in order to keep it in the same
so in order to keep it in the same
so in order to keep it in the same
position i'm going to add
position i'm going to add
position i'm going to add
a body position
a body position
a body position
to my body you could also add
to my body you could also add
to my body you could also add
a align position and if you want i can
a align position and if you want i can
a align position and if you want i can
make a video on that or even a line
make a video on that or even a line
make a video on that or even a line
orientation i can make a video on that
orientation i can make a video on that
orientation i can make a video on that
as well

but those just require too much of a
but those just require too much of a
but those just require too much of a
hassle with all of their
hassle with all of their
hassle with all of their
attachments and whatever so we have our
attachments and whatever so we have our
attachments and whatever so we have our
body position here
body position here
body position here
i'm going to set the position to 0 5
i'm going to set the position to 0 5
i'm going to set the position to 0 5
0. so if we were to run this
you can see it goes to that position and
you can see it goes to that position and
you can see it goes to that position and
it does nothing
it does nothing
it does nothing
so when we play this you'll be able to
so when we play this you'll be able to
so when we play this you'll be able to
see

what it actually does so right now you
what it actually does so right now you
what it actually does so right now you
can spin it in whichever way you want

but when i try to like make it fall down

on this axis or on the other axis

nothing happens

and the reason that is is because

we have our max torque set to like a big

the max torque on the x and z axis is is

so it can rotate let me get my root it

can rotate it can't rotate

but on the y-axis it can do whatever so
but on the y-axis it can do whatever so
but on the y-axis it can do whatever so
it can just
it can just
it can just
rotate around however much it wants
rotate around however much it wants
rotate around however much it wants
and that's the whole idea so if i were
and that's the whole idea so if i were
and that's the whole idea so if i were
to add
to add
to add
say copy this value and add it into here
if i play this
you can see it's not moving at all now
you can see it's not moving at all now
you can see it's not moving at all now
that's because the body jar is locking

i have a video on that i will link it

well why can't i just say part dot c

degrees and the reason for that

degrees and the reason for that
is that the body gyro can react with

so you can see how our body positions

then you can have it but i don't know so
then you can have it but i don't know so
then you can have it but i don't know so
you can see we can just play around with

it works perfectly fine and that's where

and it'll try to achieve those values
and it'll try to achieve those values

but if it doesn't have enough power it
but if it doesn't have enough power it
but if it doesn't have enough power it
just won't do it so
just won't do it so
just won't do it so
let's start changing some of these
let's start changing some of these
let's start changing some of these
values so this d right here is a

dampening factor so the heart like the
dampening factor so the heart like the

higher this is

the like the more smoothly it'll go but
the like the more smoothly it'll go but

let's just for
let's just for
let's just for
for fun of it let's set it to zero and
for fun of it let's set it to zero and
for fun of it let's set it to zero and
let's see what happens
let's see what happens
let's see what happens
i'm sure to run this and so you can see
i'm sure to run this and so you can see
i'm sure to run this and so you can see
because there's zero dampening it's over
because there's zero dampening it's over
because there's zero dampening it's over
correcting itself

like exponentially which is really bad
like exponentially which is really bad
like exponentially which is really bad
so let's just increase the damping to
so let's just increase the damping to
so let's just increase the damping to
like 10.
like 10.
like 10.
and you can see how like jittery it is
and you can see how like jittery it is
and you can see how like jittery it is
and that's why you always want to have
and that's why you always want to have
and that's why you always want to have
your dampening value
your dampening value
your dampening value
pretty high just to make it a little
pretty high just to make it a little
pretty high just to make it a little
more natural
and there we go so
and there we go so
and there we go so
i think i think the default value was
i think i think the default value was
i think i think the default value was
and then with the power we can set this
and then with the power we can set this
and then with the power we can set this
power to like 10
power to like 10
power to like 10
and it'll be a lot less powerful so
and it'll be a lot less powerful so
and it'll be a lot less powerful so
let's see how that works
let's see how that works
let's see how that works
you can see that setting the power to 10
you can see that setting the power to 10
you can see that setting the power to 10
the dampening is just so high it just
the dampening is just so high it just
the dampening is just so high it just
won't even do anything
won't even do anything
won't even do anything
so you can play with all these values
so you can play with all these values
so you can play with all these values
and do whatever you want with them
and do whatever you want with them
and do whatever you want with them
so lastly i'm going to do a quick little

obviously we need to have a little loop
obviously we need to have a little loop
obviously we need to have a little loop
so we're going to say while true
zoom out a little bit
well true do
well true do
well true do
there we go and we'll wait
there we go and we'll wait
there we go and we'll wait
point three let's say so every

back to 3 000 i think it was we'll see
back to 3 000 i think it was we'll see

so we have our
so we have our
so we have our
c frame look at from the part looking at

yeah i just had to wait for the
yeah i just had to wait for the
yeah i just had to wait for the
character to load in let me fix that

real quick
character added wait

there we go
there we go
there we go
and you can see this little spotlight
and you can see this little spotlight
and you can see this little spotlight
is staring at me so if we were to maybe
is staring at me so if we were to maybe
is staring at me so if we were to maybe
set the time to really late at night
set the time to really late at night
set the time to really late at night
will get a pretty cool effect
so the spotlight is following me and
