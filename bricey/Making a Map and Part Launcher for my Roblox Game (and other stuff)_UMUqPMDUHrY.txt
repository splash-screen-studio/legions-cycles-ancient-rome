i also fix a lot of game breaking bugs

i also fix a lot of game breaking bugs
which is always really good

so i just created a little basic map
so i just created a little basic map
so i just created a little basic map
for our game and i have all the player
for our game and i have all the player
for our game and i have all the player
locations plotted out right now and i
locations plotted out right now and i
locations plotted out right now and i
have the center location
have the center location
have the center location
where all of the parts will spawn so
where all of the parts will spawn so
where all of the parts will spawn so
none of this is final
none of this is final
none of this is final
i'm just kind of laying things out but
i'm just kind of laying things out but
i'm just kind of laying things out but
now i need to actually program it and by
now i need to actually program it and by
now i need to actually program it and by
the way i'll make this look better
the way i'll make this look better
the way i'll make this look better
this is just testing to make sure that
this is just testing to make sure that
this is just testing to make sure that
everything works out
everything works out
everything works out
so basically the way i want the game to
so basically the way i want the game to
so basically the way i want the game to
play out
play out
play out
is each player will get their own plot
is each player will get their own plot
is each player will get their own plot
with
with
with
these blue locations that's where
these blue locations that's where
these blue locations that's where
they'll go it'll be
they'll go it'll be
they'll go it'll be
in a more circular shape obviously as
in a more circular shape obviously as
in a more circular shape obviously as
you just saw
you just saw
you just saw
and in the center part we'll
and in the center part we'll
and in the center part we'll
be throwing parts in every direction so
be throwing parts in every direction so
be throwing parts in every direction so
what i'm thinking it'll
what i'm thinking it'll
what i'm thinking it'll
it'll like rotate periodically
it'll like rotate periodically
it'll like rotate periodically
and i'll just spit parts by adding
and i'll just spit parts by adding
and i'll just spit parts by adding
velocity

velocity
in every direction so every player
in every direction so every player
in every direction so every player
should be able to get
should be able to get
should be able to get
parts they'll be able to fight over
parts they'll be able to fight over
parts they'll be able to fight over
parts and stuff like that
parts and stuff like that
parts and stuff like that
okay so i have a system implemented now
okay so i have a system implemented now
okay so i have a system implemented now
that allows each player to join and get
that allows each player to join and get
that allows each player to join and get
their own plot
their own plot
their own plot
there's this weird issue where their
there's this weird issue where their
there's this weird issue where their
plot is like
plot is like
plot is like
15 studs tall but that should be
15 studs tall but that should be
15 studs tall but that should be
an easy fix so now i need to start
an easy fix so now i need to start
an easy fix so now i need to start
working on
working on
working on
this middle bit where our parts will be
this middle bit where our parts will be
this middle bit where our parts will be
heated for all to pick up and build with
heated for all to pick up and build with

so i've been working on the code for a

little while

and this is what i've got done so you
and this is what i've got done so you
and this is what i've got done so you
can see
can see
can see
when we spawn in this little orb at the
when we spawn in this little orb at the
when we spawn in this little orb at the
center
center
center
is spawning parts and right now it has a
is spawning parts and right now it has a

set of three parts that it uses

let me just show you real quick it's in

let me just show you real quick it's in
server storage we have our parts we have

this works

so basically the way the game work is

all of these parts are spawning in the

you got to chuck them over to your plot
you got to chuck them over to your plot
you got to chuck them over to your plot
so you can start building with them
so you can start building with them
so you can start building with them
that's what i'm doing right now
that's what i'm doing right now
that's what i'm doing right now
might actually be better in first person
so let me just get a few of these
there we go so this should be enough to
there we go so this should be enough to
there we go so this should be enough to
start out

so i'm just gonna put some parts
so i'm just gonna put some parts
so i'm just gonna put some parts
start building up my plot
start building up my plot
start building up my plot
and the rotation's honestly kind of bad

i need to figure out a better way to do

but it works for right now
okay that will work i don't really care

another raycast
another raycast
another raycast
for the mouse's position so i did a
