so in the last video we set up our tool
so in the last video we set up our tool
so in the last video we set up our tool
and we did the basic setup for our

but right now if i run this
you can see that nothing really happens

when i click and we actually want to add
when i click and we actually want to add

functionality in this video that's what

we'll be doing so first off let's go
we'll be doing so first off let's go
we'll be doing so first off let's go
to our tool which it should be located

and let's add a bull value to
and let's add a bull value to
and let's add a bull value to
our module and i'm going to name this
our module and i'm going to name this
our module and i'm going to name this
value activated

so this is going to be a boolean telling
so this is going to be a boolean telling
so this is going to be a boolean telling
whether or not the grapple gun is
whether or not the grapple gun is
whether or not the grapple gun is
activated
activated

because when the gun is activated we
because when the gun is activated we
because when the gun is activated we
don't want to activate it like while
don't want to activate it like while
don't want to activate it like while
it's activated
it's activated

if that makes sense so now in my script
if that makes sense so now in my script

i'm going to
i'm going to
i'm going to
put it in a variable and we're going to
put it in a variable and we're going to
put it in a variable and we're going to
say local activated

there we go

there we go
and so now let's go to the very bottom
and so now let's go to the very bottom
and so now let's go to the very bottom
of our script

and let's define a function local
and let's define a function local

dot is activated and this will just

return

activated dot value so the reason we do
activated dot value so the reason we do

this
this
this
is so that we don't have to like ask for
is so that we don't have to like ask for
is so that we don't have to like ask for
activated dot value
activated dot value

and we don't have to risk changing

so first before we do anything we want

we're doing this is because this will
we're doing this is because this will
we're doing this is because this will
prevent the player from
prevent the player from
prevent the player from
getting hit by our own gun because you
getting hit by our own gun because you
getting hit by our own gun because you
don't want to be able to hit yourself
don't want to be able to hit yourself
don't want to be able to hit yourself
with your own grapple gun and that's
with your own grapple gun and that's
with your own grapple gun and that's
not what we want so now we can check
not what we want so now we can check
not what we want so now we can check
in our activated event we can check if
grapple gun is activated so if it's not
grapple gun is activated so if it's not
grapple gun is activated so if it's not
activated
activated
activated
and mouse.target then
and mouse.target then
and mouse.target then
and we can put our end down here and so
and we can put our end down here and so
and we can put our end down here and so
what this does is we check if it's not
what this does is we check if it's not
what this does is we check if it's not
activated and
activated and
activated and
we have a target then we want to fire
we have a target then we want to fire
we have a target then we want to fire
the server
the server
the server
and the parameters we'll send are true
and the parameters we'll send are true
and the parameters we'll send are true
and then we want to send
and then we want to send
and then we want to send
the mouse dot hit dot position so this
the mouse dot hit dot position so this
the mouse dot hit dot position so this
is the
is the
is the
position 3d position of our mouse in
position 3d position of our mouse in

and so this will this will fire when our
and so this will this will fire when our
and so this will this will fire when our
grapple gun turns on
grapple gun turns on
grapple gun turns on
and now we want to make something for it
and now we want to make something for it
and now we want to make something for it
turns off so let's just do tool dot
turns off so let's just do tool dot
turns off so let's just do tool dot
deactivated
connect function and then we can just
connect function and then we can just
connect function and then we can just
say
say
say
message event fire server false
message event fire server false
message event fire server false
so basically we'll fire true when we
so basically we'll fire true when we
so basically we'll fire true when we
want to activate and fire false when we
want to activate and fire false when we
want to activate and fire false when we
want to
want to
want to
deactivate
and then in our server init function you
and then in our server init function you
and then in our server init function you
can see i already have this parameter
can see i already have this parameter
can see i already have this parameter
this is from some earlier testing
this is from some earlier testing
this is from some earlier testing
so make sure to put this activated
so make sure to put this activated
so make sure to put this activated
parameter let me change this for
parameter let me change this for
parameter let me change this for
there you go we have activated and we
there you go we have activated and we
there you go we have activated and we
have target position as our parameters
have target position as our parameters
have target position as our parameters
sorry i forgot to eliminate this
sorry i forgot to eliminate this
sorry i forgot to eliminate this
from my last test so it's already here
from my last test so it's already here
from my last test so it's already here
but
but
but
for you it should not be here so make
for you it should not be here so make
for you it should not be here so make
sure to have player activated and target
sure to have player activated and target
sure to have player activated and target

so now we want to set activated
so now we want to set activated
so now we want to set activated
dot value equal to underscore activated

this is just a simple naming convention
this is just a simple naming convention

then and then else
then and then else
then and then else
we can do something else so basically
we can do something else so basically
we can do something else so basically
what we want to do here is when the
what we want to do here is when the
what we want to do here is when the
grapple gun is activated we want to fire
grapple gun is activated we want to fire
grapple gun is activated we want to fire
it
it
it
if it's deactivated then we want to stop
if it's deactivated then we want to stop
if it's deactivated then we want to stop
it from

it from
firing and we'll put this functionality
firing and we'll put this functionality
firing and we'll put this functionality
in by using two more functions that
in by using two more functions that
in by using two more functions that
we'll define at the bottom
we'll define at the bottom
we'll define at the bottom
first of which is grapple gun

so let's just test to make sure
so let's just test to make sure
so let's just test to make sure
everything's working we can do a print

grapple gun dot fire up here and then
grapple gun dot fire up here and then
grapple gun dot fire up here and then
grapple gun dot reset down below so when
grapple gun dot reset down below so when
grapple gun dot reset down below so when
the grapple gun is activated we want to
the grapple gun is activated we want to
the grapple gun is activated we want to
fire it when it's not activated we want
fire it when it's not activated we want
fire it when it's not activated we want
to reset it
to reset it
to reset it
so we run this
we pull out our tool we click you can
we pull out our tool we click you can
we pull out our tool we click you can
see it says fired and then once i
see it says fired and then once i
see it says fired and then once i
release my mouse
release my mouse
release my mouse
it says reset and there you go
it says reset and there you go
it says reset and there you go
and you'll notice when i
and you'll notice when i
and you'll notice when i
fire it and then i pull out my tool it
fire it and then i pull out my tool it
fire it and then i pull out my tool it
does not say reset
does not say reset
does not say reset
that's a problem so the way we fix that
that's a problem so the way we fix that
that's a problem so the way we fix that
is by going up to
is by going up to
is by going up to
tool.deactivated and below it we can
tool.deactivated and below it we can

just say tool dot unequipped
just say tool dot unequipped

message event fire server false so
message event fire server false so
message event fire server false so
we make these two statements identical
we make these two statements identical
we make these two statements identical
so that whenever we unequip it it stops
so that whenever we unequip it it stops
so that whenever we unequip it it stops
it from firing as well because you don't

and then hook dot anchored
and then hook dot anchored
and then hook dot anchored
equal to true so you'll notice we're
equal to true so you'll notice we're

pretty close to being done all we need
pretty close to being done all we need

the script and in order to do that we'll

be using a tween so let's go to the very

and we're going to use distance divided
and we're going to use distance divided
and we're going to use distance divided
by 100 for our time
by 100 for our time
by 100 for our time
so this basically means the farther away
so this basically means the farther away
so this basically means the farther away
you click
you click
you click
the longer the distance will be so our
the longer the distance will be so our
the longer the distance will be so our

what you actually it won't take the same
what you actually it won't take the same
what you actually it won't take the same
