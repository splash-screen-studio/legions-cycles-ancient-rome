take in a world C frame or World CF
take in a world C frame or World CF
take in a world C frame or World CF
which is a C frame value so what we're
which is a C frame value so what we're
which is a C frame value so what we're
doing here is first off we need to get
doing here is first off we need to get
doing here is first off we need to get
our plot C frame and our plot size
our plot C frame and our plot size
our plot C frame and our plot size
because we have to use that to check
because we have to use that to check
because we have to use that to check
actually check the bounds and there's
actually check the bounds and there's
actually check the bounds and there's
actually a really convenient function
actually a really convenient function
actually a really convenient function
for this so we can do plot CF comma plot
for this so we can do plot CF comma plot
for this so we can do plot CF comma plot
size equals plot get bounding box so
size equals plot get bounding box so
size equals plot get bounding box so
that works out great so we have our
that works out great so we have our
that works out great so we have our
bounding we have our bounding box which
bounding we have our bounding box which
bounding we have our bounding box which
Returns the C frame and the
Returns the C frame and the
Returns the C frame and the

convert our object C
convert our object C
convert our object C
frame which is like provided in the

world CF so this world CF is like the
world CF so this world CF is like the
object C frame like in terms of the
object C frame like in terms of the
object C frame like in terms of the
world and we need to convert that to
world and we need to convert that to
world and we need to convert that to
local space so we're going to say local
local space so we're going to say local
local space so we're going to say local
object CF equals plot
object CF equals plot
object CF equals plot
CF to object space World CF so we're
CF to object space World CF so we're

taking our world CF we're kind of
taking our world CF we're kind of
taking our world CF we're kind of
localizing it to this plot so we get
localizing it to this plot so we get
localizing it to this plot so we get
that like local grid that I talked about
that like local grid that I talked about
that like local grid that I talked about
before so the center of the plot would

be 0 0 even relative to the
be 0 0 even relative to the

just manually generate all four corner
just manually generate all four corner
