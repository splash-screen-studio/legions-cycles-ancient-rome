so let's get started i'm going to start
by going into replicated storage
by going into replicated storage
by going into replicated storage
and creating a remote event
and creating a remote event
and creating a remote event
and this event i'm going to name set

let's say
let's say
let's say
an earthquake happens the server causes

all the clients to set the camera sheet
all the clients to set the camera sheet
all the clients to set the camera sheet
to true and then all the
to true and then all the
to true and then all the
clients cameras start shaking or if you
clients cameras start shaking or if you

want to be like even more advanced you
want to be like even more advanced you
want to be like even more advanced you
could add like a certain proximity so if

they're close enough
they're close enough
they're close enough
to the object then they can fire the

and we'll add a local script that
and we'll add a local script that
and we'll add a local script that
receives this event
receives this event
receives this event
and shakes the camera accordingly so
and shakes the camera accordingly so
and shakes the camera accordingly so
let's do that right now
let's do that right now
let's do that right now
so in starter player i'm going to go
so in starter player i'm going to go
so in starter player i'm going to go
into starter character scripts
into starter character scripts
into starter character scripts
and create a local script and i'm going
and create a local script and i'm going
and create a local script and i'm going
to name this logo script

and now we need to get our player model
and now we need to get our player model
and now we need to get our player model
which i guess is our character so we can

humanoid equals character
humanoid equals character
humanoid equals character
wait for child human no way there we go
wait for child human no way there we go
wait for child human no way there we go
so we have our character and we have our

a function and we're going to put in a
a function and we're going to put in a

so this will just tell us whether we
so this will just tell us whether we
so this will just tell us whether we
should shake or not
should shake or not
should shake or not
and we can add an if statement so if is
and we can add an if statement so if is
and we can add an if statement so if is
shaking

then we can also add an else
so if it's shaking we want to start
so if it's shaking we want to start
so if it's shaking we want to start
checking the camera and the way we're
checking the camera and the way we're
checking the camera and the way we're
going to do that
going to do that
going to do that
is by a function that i'm going to

run every single frame and shake the
camera depending on a few other

math functions so let's just test this
math functions so let's just test this
math functions so let's just test this
out right now by going
out right now by going

render step and then for the parameters
render step and then for the parameters
render step and then for the parameters
we're going to set our like render name
we're going to set our like render name
we're going to set our like render name
so this could just be named camera shake
so this could just be named camera shake
so this could just be named camera shake
so we can unbind it
so we can unbind it
so we can unbind it
and then we have to set the random
and then we have to set the random
and then we have to set the random
priority

which can be enum.render priority
do not forget the dot value that will
do not forget the dot value that will
do not forget the dot value that will
break your script if you forget
break your script if you forget
break your script if you forget
this dot value because this is just the
this dot value because this is just the
this dot value because this is just the
render priority value but you have to
render priority value but you have to
render priority value but you have to
say dot value to actually get the
say dot value to actually get the

and we're just going to do plus one so
and we're just going to do plus one so
and we're just going to do plus one so
it runs

before i'm not really sure
honestly it doesn't really matter we get
honestly it doesn't really matter we get
honestly it doesn't really matter we get
the same effect and then our last

which is going to be shake camera so
which is going to be shake camera so
which is going to be shake camera so
this is what it looks like right here
this is what it looks like right here
this is what it looks like right here
so just for a test we can just do print
shaking

shaking
and when this event gets fired it should
and when this event gets fired it should
and when this event gets fired it should
say

shaking so let's make a server script
to test that let's go into server script
to test that let's go into server script
to test that let's go into server script
service and

create a script and we don't really have
create a script and we don't really have
create a script and we don't really have
to name the script it's just for a test
to name the script it's just for a test
to name the script it's just for a test
so let's get replicated storage so we
so let's get replicated storage so we

if it's not shaking we want to do run
if it's not shaking we want to do run
if it's not shaking we want to do run
service unbind from render step

and the reason we need a different value
and the reason we need a different value
and the reason we need a different value
is because we're going to use
is because we're going to use
is because we're going to use
a few math functions to
