so my idea for this pod racer is almost
so my idea for this pod racer is almost
so my idea for this pod racer is almost
synonymous to what i did with my
synonymous to what i did with my
synonymous to what i did with my
first hover car that i made a few videos

ago i will link that right now so

basically what we'll have
basically what we'll have
basically what we'll have
is each engine of our pod racer will

is each engine of our pod racer will
have a
have a
have a

and so will the pod at the back
and so will the pod at the back
and so will the pod at the back
and then each engine will also have
and then each engine will also have
and then each engine will also have
a thrust going out the back
a thrust going out the back
a thrust going out the back
and the pod will not because the pod
and the pod will not because the pod
and the pod will not because the pod
will be dragged along
will be dragged along
will be dragged along
by some form of constraint right here
by some form of constraint right here
by some form of constraint right here
and i'll have to connect the engines in
and i'll have to connect the engines in
and i'll have to connect the engines in
a way that they don't
a way that they don't
a way that they don't
go crazy but they also
go crazy but they also
go crazy but they also
have a little bit of flexibility to give

have a little bit of flexibility to give
that sort of like floaty look i don't
that sort of like floaty look i don't
that sort of like floaty look i don't
want this whole pod racer to be
want this whole pod racer to be
want this whole pod racer to be
connected rigidly
connected rigidly
connected rigidly
like how the cover cars were i want each
like how the cover cars were i want each
like how the cover cars were i want each
piece of the pod racer to be
piece of the pod racer to be
piece of the pod racer to be
free-floating

but still connected in a somewhat rigid

so with this in mind i started a new
so with this in mind i started a new
so with this in mind i started a new
roblox project

and got to work on the code

so after a lot of programming and

my podracer now floated i could get onto

and i could drive forward and i used

rod constraints but then when i went

some problems began to occur and i
some problems began to occur and i
some problems began to occur and i
realized i had a lot more work to do
realized i had a lot more work to do

so i got to
so i got to

so at this point in time i got my
so at this point in time i got my
so at this point in time i got my
pod racer working pretty well

pod racer working pretty well
you can see that i had to add a part in

the middle

to prevent it from going crazy when i

went backwards

and overall it worked pretty well
and after i finished this i generated

and after i finished this i generated
some terrain

and got a basic prototype of the

so after a bunch of testing i think i've
so after a bunch of testing i think i've

come along
come along
come along
a pretty good joint setup to use for

my pod racers so it's both like

like you won't be able to see it

and it's connected to the main cab in
and it's connected to the main cab in

the back by a weld so they're rigidly

constraints going everywhere

and then some spring constraints to
and then some spring constraints to
and then some spring constraints to
basically keep
basically keep
basically keep
these two engines in the right
these two engines in the right
these two engines in the right
orientation but also give them

orientation but also give them
some leeway so if i were to play this
let me just hop in
let me just hop in

you can see i can just drive around and

if i hit something

you can see the stuff kind of balances

a lot of this stuff is probably

let me go over

okay first of all you got the two ropes

like in the movies but it also gives us

and then i got a part in the middle and
and then i got a part in the middle and

this part is welded

let me show you it's welded to the back

just so like they align properly and

there's two

there's two
ball socket constraints here and i tried

didn't go very well so i ended up going

with this nice simple

so
the engines don't

crisscross each other which happened a

and that's about it so and also
and that's about it so and also
and that's about it so and also
i also needed to think about this as

so let's go in give it a little test run
if i can just hop up here if i can there
if i can just hop up here if i can there
if i can just hop up here if i can there
we go

so if i drive it around it's kind of
