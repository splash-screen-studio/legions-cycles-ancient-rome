along a line between two points it's

but instead of applying a force in a

so let's demonstrate how it works so i'm
so let's demonstrate how it works so i'm

going to create a block
going to create a block
going to create a block
right here and then i'm going to

duplicate it

move it across real quick there we go

and then i'm going to make a line force
and then i'm going to make a line force
and then i'm going to make a line force
in between them so i'm going to go to
in between them so i'm going to go to
in between them so i'm going to go to
model create

line force and then we're going to put
line force and then we're going to put

an attachment there
an attachment there
an attachment there
and drag it all the way over and put an
and drag it all the way over and put an
and drag it all the way over and put an
attachment there so this is a line force
attachment there so this is a line force
attachment there so this is a line force
it consists of

it consists of
two attachments as opposed to the one of

and it basically just

pulls this part along whichever part has
pulls this part along whichever part has
pulls this part along whichever part has
a line for so in this case this part

a line for so in this case this part
it'll pull it along to meet that part
it'll pull it along to meet that part
it'll pull it along to meet that part
so let's just run it out with his

default settings real quick

you can see it pulls it along and since
you can see it pulls it along and since
you can see it pulls it along and since
this part isn't anchored it just brings
this part isn't anchored it just brings
this part isn't anchored it just brings
it along with it let's just anchor it so
it along with it let's just anchor it so
it along with it let's just anchor it so
it looks a little bit better
it looks a little bit better
it looks a little bit better
you see it rails into it and it's
you see it rails into it and it's
you see it rails into it and it's
attracted to that part

and no matter where you put it it'll
and no matter where you put it it'll
and no matter where you put it it'll
always go
always go
always go
towards the part and a line so if we go

constraint details you can see when i

drag it you see that little arrow

it's pointing towards the part no matter

and so to be honest you could probably
and so to be honest you could probably

make a vector force do this as well
make a vector force do this as well
make a vector force do this as well
using a bunch of vector math but this
using a bunch of vector math but this
using a bunch of vector math but this
makes it a lot easier
makes it a lot easier
makes it a lot easier
to do this without using any code

that's the benefit of using a line force

that's the benefit of using a line force
and a really cool thing with line forces

is all the nice properties you have so

let me unanchor this real quick to show

you one of the best ones
you one of the best ones
you one of the best ones
is the reaction force so this basically
is the reaction force so this basically
is the reaction force so this basically
makes it so that both
makes it so that both
makes it so that both
parts are attracted to each other so
parts are attracted to each other so
parts are attracted to each other so
this is sort of like a
this is sort of like a
this is sort of like a
magnet for example
magnet for example
magnet for example
so you can see when you play they both
so you can see when you play they both
so you can see when you play they both
get attracted towards
get attracted towards
get attracted towards
each other which is really cool
each other which is really cool

and so along with being able to attract
and so along with being able to attract
and so along with being able to attract
the two attachments

using line forces you can also repel
using line forces you can also repel
using line forces you can also repel
them by setting the magnitude property

which is basically the strength of the

to a negative value and that gives you

to a negative value and that gives you
something like that which is
something like that which is
something like that which is
quite cool and also you can turn
quite cool and also you can turn
quite cool and also you can turn
on the inverse square law little thing
on the inverse square law little thing

and this basically means that depending

apart is less force will be added

so you can see there it's a lot slower
