so i have right in front of me a part
so i have right in front of me a part

to do that but we're going to use this
to do that but we're going to use this
to do that but we're going to use this
part to

use the new recast function
use the new recast function
use the new recast function
and so now i'm going to go into my part
and so now i'm going to go into my part
and so now i'm going to go into my part
and create a script and we're just going
and create a script and we're just going
and create a script and we're just going
to make a basic raycast
to make a basic raycast
to make a basic raycast
and so the function that we're using is
and so the function that we're using is
and so the function that we're using is
obviously

obviously
workspace.raycast so this is what it
workspace.raycast so this is what it
workspace.raycast so this is what it
looks like workspace
looks like workspace
looks like workspace
colon raycast it's a lot simpler than

but it just adds it takes away a

function so it takes in three parameters
function so it takes in three parameters
function so it takes in three parameters
the origin the direction and optional
the origin the direction and optional
the origin the direction and optional
parameter which is the raycast params
there we go so obviously i haven't
there we go so obviously i haven't
there we go so obviously i haven't
defined any of these so they're all red
defined any of these so they're all red
defined any of these so they're all red
but and also it returns a raycast result
so there we go so this is basically the
so there we go so this is basically the
so there we go so this is basically the
signature of our

worry about the raycast params for now

worry about the raycast params for now
it's really powerful but let's just talk
it's really powerful but let's just talk
it's really powerful but let's just talk
about
about
about
the most useful things which are the

origin direction and result because
origin direction and result because

these are the things you'll be using
these are the things you'll be using
these are the things you'll be using
most most of the time so i'm going to
most most of the time so i'm going to
most most of the time so i'm going to
find the origin
find the origin
find the origin
which will be part dot position and find

and if you really want to or like you're

using a user input service function
using a user input service function
using a user input service function
you could define your array which would
you could define your array which would
you could define your array which would
be array.new
be array.new

origin direction and then when you're

putting it into the right cast function
putting it into the right cast function
putting it into the right cast function
you can do ray
you can do ray

dot origin and array dot direction

there you go so you could also do that i
there you go so you could also do that i

wouldn't recommend it because it adds an

extra line of code you have to

that's just not as good and simple as
that's just not as good and simple as
that's just not as good and simple as
just saying origin
just saying origin
just saying origin
and direction so let me just get rid of

so now if i were to run this
so now if i were to run this
so now if i were to run this
you can see nothing happens obviously

you can see nothing happens obviously
because we have no code that does

because we have no code that does
anything but now let's talk about the
anything but now let's talk about the
anything but now let's talk about the
raycast result
raycast result

which is the thing that gets returned
which is the thing that gets returned
which is the thing that gets returned
when you perform a successful recast and
when you perform a successful recast and
when you perform a successful recast and
since

it only gets returned when you perform a

you have to check if it exists because
you have to check if it exists because
you have to check if it exists because
if you cast into the sky and there's
if you cast into the sky and there's
if you cast into the sky and there's
like nothing there
like nothing there
like nothing there
then it won't do anything so we have to
then it won't do anything so we have to
then it won't do anything so we have to
check if raycast result
check if raycast result
check if raycast result
then and now let's list some of the
then and now let's list some of the
then and now let's list some of the
properties

so raycast result dot
so raycast result dot
so raycast result dot
position is just the position in which
position is just the position in which
position is just the position in which
the ray
the ray
the ray
collides and then
collides and then
collides and then
raycast result
dot instance is the part or terrain in
dot instance is the part or terrain in
dot instance is the part or terrain in
which it collides with

which it collides with
and these are probably the two most
and these are probably the two most
and these are probably the two most
important but then
important but then
important but then
some really useful ones is
raycast normal
and so the normal is basically a vector
and so the normal is basically a vector
and so the normal is basically a vector
three that just describes like the angle
three that just describes like the angle
three that just describes like the angle
at which your part
at which your part
at which your part
that the instance is situated so um
that the instance is situated so um
that the instance is situated so um
it's kind of hard to explain i think i
it's kind of hard to explain i think i
it's kind of hard to explain i think i
explained it in better detail in my

earlier you didn't see me set it up
earlier you didn't see me set it up
earlier you didn't see me set it up
because it was like last clip

so here we have our part let's just move
so here we have our part let's just move
so here we have our part let's just move
it a little closer
it a little closer
it a little closer
and if we were to run this
you can see the position is 11 well the
you can see the position is 11 well the
you can see the position is 11 well the

we can test this a little better

so this is everything you need to know
so this is everything you need to know
so this is everything you need to know
about the raycast
about the raycast
about the raycast
result so now let's go into raycast
result so now let's go into raycast

in order to set it to ignore them you

you can see it still hits our green part

it skips over red and blue but if we

it'll obviously hit the red part

so this allows you to define a collision

your rays can be casted so let's just go
your rays can be casted so let's just go
your rays can be casted so let's just go
create some collision groups real quick

i'm going to go to model and then

i put it like i docked it down here and

this is

so all of these parts will not collide
so all of these parts will not collide
so all of these parts will not collide

what makes it even more useful is the

you can see it hits red

real quick

that almost threw off that right there

it'll hit the blue one and what's really
