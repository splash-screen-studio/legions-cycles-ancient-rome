so before you use remote events and
so before you use remote events and
so before you use remote events and
remote functions you first need to know
remote functions you first need to know
remote functions you first need to know
what they do
what they do
what they do
and how they work so basically the main
and how they work so basically the main
and how they work so basically the main
purpose of these
purpose of these
purpose of these
functions and events is to communicate
functions and events is to communicate
functions and events is to communicate
between the server
between the server
between the server
which is where like scripts are run and
which is where like scripts are run and
which is where like scripts are run and
the client which is each
the client which is each

simulated and whatever
simulated and whatever

so you can do that with either remote
so you can do that with either remote

events or remote functions and

prior to filtering enabled you didn't

really need this but

since filtering enables a thing where

basically the client can't really edit

basically the client can't really edit
whatever the server sees unless the

we have to use remote events and remote
we have to use remote events and remote
we have to use remote events and remote
functions which is good

so people can't just exploit your game

so let's start with remote events a
so let's start with remote events a
so let's start with remote events a
remote event basically

sends a signal from either the server to

so it's one way so you can send you can

send a signal that just tells it to do

and that's good but that only works if
and that's good but that only works if
and that's good but that only works if
you want
you want
you want
a one-way connection if you want to
a one-way connection if you want to
a one-way connection if you want to
send something if the client wants to

send something to the server
send something to the server
and the server wants to give something

in order to like verify it that's when
in order to like verify it that's when

you use a remote function
you use a remote function
you use a remote function
so let's say the client sends something
so let's say the client sends something
so let's say the client sends something
to the server
to the server
to the server
the server processes it and in the end
the server processes it and in the end
the server processes it and in the end
it sends back another value
it sends back another value
it sends back another value
and this is exactly how a function a

non-void function

non-void function
would work in lua so you could have a

and that's exactly how it would work but
and that's exactly how it would work but
and that's exactly how it would work but
instead of a normal function

instead of a normal function
it'd just be a remote function

so i'm here in roblox studio and let's

first thing you want to keep in mind
first thing you want to keep in mind
first thing you want to keep in mind
when you're making your remote event
when you're making your remote event
when you're making your remote event
events and functions is where to put

you want to put in a place where both
you want to put in a place where both
you want to put in a place where both
the client and server can see it

create a remote event and let's also

it'll always send the player who sent it

so put player comma message because you
so put player comma message because you
so put player comma message because you
always get the player sent
always get the player sent
always get the player sent
so and now we can print player.name
says

your ic763 says hello that's

you can say remote event fire
you can say remote event fire
you can say remote event fire
client or we could say remote event

fire all clients so fire client
fire all clients so fire client

basically fires a single client and

it'll take in the parameter
it'll take in the parameter

because we have to wait for the

we'll get the player and we'll fire the
we'll get the player and we'll fire the

first player which should be me since
i'm playing a single player
i'm playing a single player
i'm playing a single player
so we'll do remote event dot on client
so we'll do remote event dot on client

server which is good

so on client event connect a function
and the client does not get any default

parameters so we can just print
parameters so we can just print

client was called
and there you go so that's the basics of
and there you go so that's the basics of
and there you go so that's the basics of
remote events so you'll notice that this
remote events so you'll notice that this
remote events so you'll notice that this
is a one-way single so if i were to

is a one-way single so if i were to
return one or like return a value
return one or like return a value
return one or like return a value
no one would get that like the remote
no one would get that like the remote

not capture that and return it

that's where remote functions come in

so i have a function and it obviously

gets the player so we can

return 10 or something
return 10 or something
return 10 or something
and so we can print server

and it prints 10. and a very useful you

constant equals 10 and you could return

success so basically what would happen
here is like let's say the player wants

then we'll set success to true and will

then we'll set success to true and will
return success so the client will know

back to here so
this we need a sanity check right here
this we need a sanity check right here

and basically what do we want our sanity

check to do we want to check

check to do we want to check
if our player is able to buy this so we
if our player is able to buy this so we
if our player is able to buy this so we
can just say
can just say
can just say
if money dot value is greater than or
if money dot value is greater than or
if money dot value is greater than or
equal to cost
equal to cost
equal to cost
then we can
then we can
then we can
subtract the money value so you'll see
subtract the money value so you'll see

success which will originally equal

false
false
false
and then we'll set success equal to true
and then we'll set success equal to true
and then we'll set success equal to true
but
but
but
if we're not successful we'll set
if we're not successful we'll set
if we're not successful we'll set
success equal to false

this won't be successful
so it'll print false but if you want to

it will be successful and it'll subtract
it will be successful and it'll subtract
it will be successful and it'll subtract
our money so just add like so you can
