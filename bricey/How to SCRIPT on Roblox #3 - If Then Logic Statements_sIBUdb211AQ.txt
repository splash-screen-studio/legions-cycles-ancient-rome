so in this video we're going to be
so in this video we're going to be
so in this video we're going to be
talking about if statements
talking about if statements
talking about if statements
and logic so basically what an if
and logic so basically what an if
and logic so basically what an if
statement is is it's a crucial code
statement is is it's a crucial code
statement is is it's a crucial code
structure that uses logic to determine

all about if statements how you can use
all about if statements how you can use
all about if statements how you can use
them where you can use them

so i'm going to go into server skip
so i'm going to go into server skip
so i'm going to go into server skip
service and create a script
service and create a script
service and create a script
and i'm just going to define a simple if
and i'm just going to define a simple if
and i'm just going to define a simple if
statement
so an if statement basically consists of
so an if statement basically consists of
so an if statement basically consists of
the word if
the word if
the word if
and then condition then
and then condition then
and then condition then
and then you press enter and it will
and then you press enter and it will
and then you press enter and it will
automatically do end so
automatically do end so
automatically do end so
basically how it if statement works is
basically how it if statement works is
basically how it if statement works is
it's like a crossroads or like a
it's like a crossroads or like a
it's like a crossroads or like a
junction
junction
junction
there's multiple ways where it can go
there's multiple ways where it can go
there's multiple ways where it can go
and the way it determines what thing to
and the way it determines what thing to
and the way it determines what thing to
do is by the condition so let me define
do is by the condition so let me define
do is by the condition so let me define
a variable
a variable
a variable
and call this condition so condition
and call this condition so condition
and call this condition so condition
if the condition is true so condition
if the condition is true so condition
if the condition is true so condition
equals true
equals true
equals true
then the code inside of the if statement
then the code inside of the if statement
then the code inside of the if statement
will run so
will run so
will run so
i'm going to print ran so it checks
i'm going to print ran so it checks
i'm going to print ran so it checks
if condition it evaluates condition so
if condition it evaluates condition so
if condition it evaluates condition so
condition
condition
condition
we define is true then we print ran
we define is true then we print ran
we define is true then we print ran
so where to run this you can see
so where to run this you can see
so where to run this you can see
it print ran now if condition
it print ran now if condition
it print ran now if condition
were false it wouldn't run
so this is all good for explaining but
so this is all good for explaining but
so this is all good for explaining but
in reality you almost never just use a
in reality you almost never just use a
in reality you almost never just use a
boolean value and then
boolean value and then
boolean value and then
have a condition variable
have a condition variable
have a condition variable
what it usually goes is using logic
what it usually goes is using logic
what it usually goes is using logic
statements
statements
statements
so let me give you a quick example
so let me give you a quick example
so let me give you a quick example
so 1 is less than 5.
so 1 is less than 5.
so 1 is less than 5.
this is a simple logic statement that
this is a simple logic statement that
this is a simple logic statement that
uses this operator right here with the
uses this operator right here with the
uses this operator right here with the
less than operator
less than operator
less than operator
and basically says if one is less than
and basically says if one is less than
and basically says if one is less than
five
five
five
then you print ran and that's obviously
then you print ran and that's obviously
then you print ran and that's obviously
true
true
true
so it prints ran
and you can also put variables here so
and you can also put variables here so
and you can also put variables here so
let's say
let's say
let's say
i have local var one equals one and then
i have local var one equals one and then
i have local var one equals one and then
local
local
local
var2 equals five if i
var2 equals five if i
var2 equals five if i
put var1 here is less than var2
put var1 here is less than var2
put var1 here is less than var2
same numbers again so it should be rand
and this works for all types of like
and this works for all types of like
and this works for all types of like
basic math operators so
basic math operators so
basic math operators so
greater than works greater than or equal
greater than works greater than or equal
greater than works greater than or equal
to okay this is less than or equal to
to okay this is less than or equal to
to okay this is less than or equal to
works
works
works
and then greater than or equal to so
and then greater than or equal to so
and then greater than or equal to so
these are all the ways to do it
these are all the ways to do it
these are all the ways to do it
and then there's one other thing that
and then there's one other thing that
and then there's one other thing that
you can do
you can do
you can do
is it's checking if one value is equal
is it's checking if one value is equal
is it's checking if one value is equal
to another value
to another value
to another value
and you may think that you just put a
and you may think that you just put a
and you may think that you just put a
normal equal sign here
normal equal sign here
normal equal sign here
but you can see it has an error
but you can see it has an error
but you can see it has an error
and this error is it like
and this error is it like
and this error is it like
you it thinks that you're defining a new
you it thinks that you're defining a new
you it thinks that you're defining a new
variable
variable
variable
so the way that if statements work is
so the way that if statements work is
so the way that if statements work is
you have to use a double equal sign
you have to use a double equal sign
you have to use a double equal sign
to compare two values so if r1 is equal
to compare two values so if r1 is equal
to compare two values so if r1 is equal
to var2
to var2
to var2
and that's obviously false but if i were
and that's obviously false but if i were
and that's obviously false but if i were
to say set var one to five
to say set var one to five
to say set var one to five
it'll be true
and so this functionality for if
and so this functionality for if
and so this functionality for if
statements also carries on to the
statements also carries on to the
statements also carries on to the
roblox world so if i were to go back
roblox world so if i were to go back
roblox world so if i were to go back
into my script
into my script
into my script
and create a baseplate variable so local
and create a baseplate variable so local
and create a baseplate variable so local
baseplate equals

if we were to run this you see it
if we were to run this you see it
if we were to run this you see it
wouldn't run
wouldn't run
wouldn't run
but if i were to compare place plate dot
but if i were to compare place plate dot
but if i were to compare place plate dot
transparency to

so that's just something to keep in mind
so that's just something to keep in mind
so that's just something to keep in mind
it works for all
it works for all
it works for all
data types whatever so if you remember

first one is else so basically what this
first one is else so basically what this
first one is else so basically what this
means is it checks if

means is it checks if
condition so if this condition is equal
condition so if this condition is equal
condition so if this condition is equal
to true this line right here
to true this line right here
to true this line right here
then we run this l so if this condition
then we run this l so if this condition
then we run this l so if this condition
is not equal to true
is not equal to true
is not equal to true
then we run this and we'll just print
then we run this and we'll just print
then we run this and we'll just print
not true
not true

so basically one of these code blocks
so basically one of these code blocks
so basically one of these code blocks
right here
right here
right here
will run both of them will never run
will run both of them will never run
will run both of them will never run
that's one thing to keep in mind when
that's one thing to keep in mind when
that's one thing to keep in mind when
using an if statement so if i were to
using an if statement so if i were to
using an if statement so if i were to
run this
run this
run this
it prints ran and if i were to change
it prints ran and if i were to change
it prints ran and if i were to change
this

this
to let's say 1.5 there we go
to let's say 1.5 there we go
to let's say 1.5 there we go
it would print not true because the
it would print not true because the
it would print not true because the
logic statement
logic statement
logic statement
returns false
but then let's say you have multiple
but then let's say you have multiple
but then let's say you have multiple
conditions that you want to check for
conditions that you want to check for
conditions that you want to check for
and you still want to keep an if
and you still want to keep an if
and you still want to keep an if
statement you'll use a
statement you'll use a
statement you'll use a
keyword else if one word so this is
keyword else if one word so this is
keyword else if one word so this is
the same thing as if just in the same
the same thing as if just in the same
the same thing as if just in the same
code block so
code block so
code block so
if i say else if base plate
if i say else if base plate
if i say else if base plate
dot transparency equals
zero then so basically what will happen
zero then so basically what will happen
zero then so basically what will happen
here
here
here
is i can print
is i can print
is i can print
else if whatever what will happen
else if whatever what will happen
else if whatever what will happen
is it'll say only one of these will run
is it'll say only one of these will run
is it'll say only one of these will run
and if it meets this value then this
and if it meets this value then this
and if it meets this value then this
will run first
will run first
will run first
if it meets this value then this will
if it meets this value then this will
if it meets this value then this will
run

run
but if they're like the same value
then it'll ignore both of these and just
then it'll ignore both of these and just
then it'll ignore both of these and just
go to this one obviously
go to this one obviously
go to this one obviously
so let's set this to zero just to show
so let's set this to zero just to show
so let's set this to zero just to show
you that it works

let's play this you can see it says else
let's play this you can see it says else
let's play this you can see it says else
ift and you can chain these for as long

work perfectly fine so let's say you
work perfectly fine so let's say you
work perfectly fine so let's say you

check if a value is not equal to another
check if a value is not equal to another
check if a value is not equal to another
value the way you do this in lua is by
value the way you do this in lua is by
value the way you do this in lua is by
using the tilde
using the tilde
using the tilde
and the equals key so this checks if
and the equals key so this checks if
and the equals key so this checks if
baseplate.transparency is not equal to
baseplate.transparency is not equal to
baseplate.transparency is not equal to
0.5 and this is true so it runs it
which is great now the only other

real big thing you need to know about in
real big thing you need to know about in
real big thing you need to know about in
regards to your if statements
regards to your if statements
regards to your if statements
is the key word not so what this
is the key word not so what this
is the key word not so what this
basically does
basically does
basically does
is let me just demonstrate up here is if
is let me just demonstrate up here is if
is let me just demonstrate up here is if
i print not true
it'll print false
and if i print not false
and if i print not false
and if i print not false
it'll print true
it'll print true
it'll print true
so this basically inverts the value of a
so this basically inverts the value of a
so this basically inverts the value of a
boolean
boolean
boolean
so if your variable is false it'll make
so if your variable is false it'll make
so if your variable is false it'll make
it true
it true
it true
if it's true then it'll make it false
if it's true then it'll make it false
if it's true then it'll make it false
and this is very very useful
and this is very very useful
and this is very very useful
in regards to logic so i can check if
in regards to logic so i can check if
in regards to logic so i can check if
not baseplate.transparency is not equal
not baseplate.transparency is not equal
not baseplate.transparency is not equal
i should make this easier we're going to
i should make this easier we're going to
i should make this easier we're going to
change this to equal so it'll check if
change this to equal so it'll check if
change this to equal so it'll check if
baseplate.transparency is equal to 0.5
baseplate.transparency is equal to 0.5
baseplate.transparency is equal to 0.5
if this is true then it'll make it false
if this is true then it'll make it false
if this is true then it'll make it false
but if it's false it'll make it true so
but if it's false it'll make it true so
but if it's false it'll make it true so
right now it should be false so if you
right now it should be false so if you
right now it should be false so if you
run this
run this
run this
you can see it prints our first block
you can see it prints our first block
you can see it prints our first block
in here and the reason i have
in here and the reason i have
in here and the reason i have
parentheses here
parentheses here
parentheses here
is because whenever you're using not you
is because whenever you're using not you
is because whenever you're using not you
really want to put parentheses around
really want to put parentheses around
really want to put parentheses around
your condition

your condition
before you negate it
